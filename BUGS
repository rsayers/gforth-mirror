gforth.el: indentation does not work right on the first line of a
buffer. anton 27jan95

Conditional compilation continues after the file ends. This is allowed
by the standard (through an ambiguous condition), but the compiler
should at least produce a warning.  anton 27jan95

QUERY and TIB may behave differently than some may expect. TIB always
points to the current SOURCE, and QUERY puts its result there.  anton

open-path-file expands "./" into the sourcefilename. It should either
not expand "./" or provide a mechanism that allows the application to
determine what "./" should expand to. anton 16jun98

gforth.el: Typing <ret> does not work when tabs separate words in a
line, and there is a \-comment at the end of the line.  anton 19feb00

SEE does not work when the control structure is too complex (e.g.,
load http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/pentomino.fs and then do
SEE NEXT-PIECE). anton 5mar2000

Include cannot handle lines longer than 255 characters.  anton 4sep00

Errors happening during a LOAD do not report the offending word and
its context (e.g., the 64-byte line). anton 8sep00

Our ecvt routine apparently does not work correctly for Infs and NaNs.
Try "ac_cv_func_ecvt=no ./configure; make" and then in Gforth: "1e 0e
f/ f. 0e 0e f/ f.". anton 25sep00

Our ecvt routine does not round correctly, e.g., 0.25->0.3. Marcel

Newline has only LF (instead of CRLF) in DOS.  Bruce Hoyt 25oct2000

SIGPIPE can make Gforth hard to stop (e.g., 
gforth -m 2M wordfreq.fs -e bye|head

F. does not print trailing zeroes (e.g., "10 SET-PRECISION 125e f.")

It may be useful for printing tables of FP numbers to have ways to
control the number of digits before and after the decimal point.

Block 0 does not work as it should: "0 block drop update save-buffers"
does not write to the blocks file.  "0 block 1024 dump" seems to give
the previous contents of the buffer.  Travis Bemann 10jul2001
<3b4b4f57$0$42883$272ea4a1@news.execpc.com>

When accessing a block beyond the end of the block file, the result is
filled with spaces (this is also documented).  However, when accessing
a previously unwritten block before the end of the block file, we will
get a block full of zeroes on most (all?) OSs.  This inconsistency
should be eliminated and the documentation fixed.  anton 14jul2001
