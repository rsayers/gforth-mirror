\ the intention for this format is to ship Gforth's files to
\ limited systems in a very simple format (simpler than tar)
\ so that unpacking is totally trivial.
\ File system capabilities expected are similar to vfat
\ no date stamp is given
\ the file is supposed to be compressed with zlib afterwards

\ Format of each file:
\ 32 bit len type filename\0 - counted+zero-terminated, aligned to 4 bytes
\ 32 bit size, little endian, aligend to 4 bytes
\ file contents, plus alignment to 4 bytes
\ type is:
\ 'f' for file,
\ 'd' for directory,
\ 's' for symlink (can't create now),
\ 'h' for hardlink (can't create now)
\ rules for directories are: Specify each before first use
