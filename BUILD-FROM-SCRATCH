# To build gforth from scratch you need autoconf, automake and a 
# gforth0.5.0
# This file can be used as shell script. If you make the environment
# variable GFORTH point to an existing gforth installation, this
# script takes over the whole build process and will produce the
# kernel kernel images from the sources as well

# try to guess a installed gforth

autoconf

# if you have specified a previous Gforth, you can savely run make now
# with FORTHK and FORTHP changed appropriate.

#a local gforth.fi probably does not work with $GFORTH
