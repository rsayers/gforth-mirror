This directory contains assembler and primitives for the 4stack
processor. Create an gforth image for the misc simulator with

make kernl-4stack.fi

This also creates the file gforth.4o for the simulator in the directory
../4stack.

Load this image into the simulator and run the simulator with

cd ../4stack; 4stack gforth.4o

Additonally, there are two more complex examples (two terminal games,
Sokoban and Tetris). To create the image, do the following:

Add

include arch/misc/sokoban.fs
include arch/misc/tt.fs

in main.fs just before "include special.fs". Perform a make
kernl-4stack.fi like above. Move the resulting gforth.4o to
gforth-games.4o, and start the simulator:

cd ../4stack
mv gforth.4o gforth-games.4o
4stack gforth-games.4o

Now type in "sokoban" <return> or "tt" <return> to play sokoban or
tetris (both run at reasonable speed on a Pentium 133). To stop either
game, type "q".

More informations about the 4stack processor, including a description
of the architecture, a user manual, a simulator, and a description of
a sample implementation in Verilog can be found in
