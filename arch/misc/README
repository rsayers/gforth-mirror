This directory contains simulator, assembler and primitives for the
MISC-chip. Create an gforth image for the misc simulator with

make kernl-misc.fi

Load this image into the simulator and run the simulator with

gforth arch/misc/sim.fs -e "load kernl-misc.fi g"

Additonally, there are two more complex examples (two terminal games,
Sokoban and Tetris). To create the image games-misc.fi, do the
following:

Add

include arch/misc/sokoban.fs
include arch/misc/tt.fs

in main.fs just before "include special.fs". Perform a make
kernl-misc.fi like above. Move the result to games-misc.fi, and start
the simulator with

gforth arch/misc/sim.fs -e "load games-misc.fi g"

Now type in "sokoban" <return> or "tt" <return> to play sokoban or
tetris (be aware: both are very slow!). To stop either game, type "q".
