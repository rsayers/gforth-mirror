@unnumbered GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
@center Version 2, June 1991

@display
Copyright @copyright{} 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
@end display

@unnumberedsec Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

@iftex
@unnumberedsec TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end ifinfo

@enumerate 0
@item
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

@item
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

@item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

@enumerate a
@item
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

@item
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

@item
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
@end enumerate

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

@item
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
@end enumerate

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

@item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

@item
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

@item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

@item
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

@item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

@item

@unnumberedsec How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

@chapter Goals of Gforth
@cindex goals of the Gforth project
The goal of the Gforth Project is to develop a standard model for
ANS Forth. This can be split into several subgoals:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Gforth should conform to the ANS Forth Standard.
@item
It should be a model, i.e. it should define all the
implementation-dependent things.
@item
It should become standard, i.e. widely accepted and used. This goal
is the most difficult one.
@end itemize

To achieve these goals Gforth should be
@itemize @bullet
@item
Similar to previous models (fig-Forth, F83)
@item
Powerful. It should provide for all the things that are considered
necessary today and even some that are not yet considered necessary.
@item
Efficient. It should not get the reputation of being exceptionally
slow.
@item
Free.
@item
Available on many machines/easy to port.
@end itemize

Have we achieved these goals? Gforth conforms to the ANS Forth
standard. It may be considered a model, but we have not yet documented
which parts of the model are stable and which parts we are likely to
change. It certainly has not yet become a de facto standard, but it
appears to be quite popular. It has some similarities to and some
differences from previous models. It has some powerful features, but not
yet everything that we envisioned. We certainly have achieved our
execution speed goals (@pxref{Performance}).  It is free and available
on many machines.

@section Is it a Sin to use Gforth Extensions?
@cindex Gforth extensions

If you've been paying attention, you will have realised that there is an
ANS (American National Standard) for Forth. As you read through the rest
of this manual, you will see documentation for @var{Standard} words, and
documentation for some appealing Gforth @var{extensions}. You might ask
yourself the question: @var{``Given that there is a standard, would I be
committing a sin to use (non-Standard) Gforth extensions?''}

The answer to that question is somewhat pragmatic and somewhat
philosophical. Consider these points:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A number of the Gforth extensions can be implemented in ANS Forth using
files provided in the @file{compat/} directory. These are mentioned in
the text in passing.
@item
Forth has a rich historical precedent for programmers taking advantage
of implementation-dependent features of their tools (for example,
relying on a knowledge of the dictionary structure). Sometimes these
techniques are necessary to extract every last bit of performance from
the hardware, sometimes they are just a programming shorthand.
@item
The best way to break the rules is to know what the rules are. To learn
the rules, there is no substitute for studying the text of the Standard
itself. In particular, Appendix A of the Standard (@var{Rationale})
provides a valuable insight into the thought processes of the technical
committee.
@item
The best reason to break a rule is because you have to; because it's
more productive to do that, because it makes your code run fast enough
or because you can see no Standard way to achieve what you want to
achieve.
@end itemize

The tool @file{ans-report.fs} (@pxref{ANS Report}) makes it easy to
analyse your program and determine what non-Standard definitions it
relies upon.

@chapter An Introduction to ANS Forth
@cindex Forth - an introduction

The primary purpose of this manual is to document Gforth. However, since
Forth is not a widely-known language and there is a lack of up-to-date
teaching material, it seems worthwhile to provide some introductory
material. @xref{Forth-related information} for other sources of Forth-related
information.

The examples in this section should work on any ANS Forth; the
output shown was produced using Gforth. Each example attempts to
reproduce the exact output that Gforth produces. If you try out the
examples (and you should), what you should type is shown @kbd{like this}
and Gforth's response is shown @code{like this}. The single exception is
that, where the example shows @kbd{<return>} it means that you should
press the ``carriage return'' key. Unfortunately, some output formats for
this manual cannot show the difference between @kbd{this} and
@code{this} which will make trying out the examples harder (but not
impossible).

Forth is an unusual language. It provides an interactive development
environment which includes both an interpreter and compiler. Forth
programming style encourages you to break a problem down into many
@cindex factoring
small fragments (@var{factoring}), and then to develop and test each
fragment interactively. Forth advocates assert that breaking the
edit-compile-test cycle used by conventional programming languages can
lead to great productivity improvements.

@node Introducing the Text Interpreter, Stacks and Postfix notation, Introduction, Introduction
@section Introducing the Text Interpreter
@cindex text interpreter
@cindex outer interpreter

When you invoke the Forth image, you will see a startup banner printed
and nothing else (if you have Gforth installed on your system, try
invoking it now, by typing @kbd{gforth<return>}). Forth is now running
its command line interpreter, which is called the @var{Text Interpreter}
(also known as the @var{Outer Interpreter}).  (You will learn a lot
about the text interpreter as you read through this chapter,
but @pxref{The Text Interpreter} for more detail).

Although it's not obvious, Forth is actually waiting for your
input. Type a number and press the <return> key:

@example
@kbd{45<return>}  ok
@end example

Rather than give you a prompt to invite you to input something, the text
interpreter prints a status message @var{after} it has processed a line
of input. The status message in this case (``@code{ ok}'' followed by
carriage-return) indicates that the text interpreter was able to process
all of your input successfully. Now type something illegal:

@example
@kbd{qwer341<return>}
:1: Undefined word
qwer341
^^^^^^^
$400D2BA8 Bounce
$400DBDA8 no.extensions
@end example

The exact text, other than the ``Undefined word'' may differ slightly on
your system, but the effect is the same; when the text interpreter
detects an error, it discards any remaining text on a line, resets
certain internal state and prints an error message.

The text interpreter waits for you to press carrage-return, and then
processes your input line. Starting at the beginning of the line, it
breaks the line into groups of characters separated by spaces. For each
group of characters in turn, it makes two attempts to do something:

@itemize @bullet
@item
It tries to treat it as a command. It does this by searching a @var{name
dictionary}. If the group of characters matches an entry in the name
dictionary, the name dictionary provides the text interpreter with
information that allows the text interpreter perform some actions. In
Forth jargon, we say that the group
@cindex word
@cindex definition
@cindex execution token
@cindex xt
of characters names a @var{word}, that the dictionary search returns an
@var{execution token (xt)} corresponding to the @var{definition} of the
word, and that the text interpreter executes the xt. Often, the terms
@var{word} and @var{definition} are used interchangeably.
@item
If the text interpreter fails to find a match in the name dictionary, it
tries to treat the group of characters as a number in the current number
base (when you start up Forth, the current number base is base 10). If
the group of characters legitimately represents a number, the text
interpreter pushes the number onto a stack (we'll learn more about that
in the next section).
@end itemize

If the text interpreter is unable to do either of these things with any
group of characters, it discards the group of characters and the rest of
the line, then prints an error message. If the text interpreter reaches
the end of the line without error, it prints the status message ``@code{ ok}''
followed by carriage-return.

This is the simplest command we can give to the text interpreter:

@example
@kbd{<return>}  ok
@end example

The text interpreter did everything we asked it to do (nothing) without
an error, so it said that everything is ``@code{ ok}''. Try a slightly longer
command:

@example
@kbd{12 dup fred dup<return>}
:1: Undefined word
12 dup fred dup
       ^^^^
$400D2BA8 Bounce
$400DBDA8 no.extensions
@end example

When you press the carriage-return key, the text interpreter starts to
work its way along the line:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When it gets to the space after the @code{2}, it takes the group of
characters @code{12} and looks them up in the name
dictionary@footnote{We can't tell if it found them or not, but assume
for now that it did not}. There is no match for this group of characters
in the name dictionary, so it tries to treat them as a number. It is
able to do this successfully, so it puts the number, 12, ``on the stack''
(whatever that means).
@item
The text interpreter resumes scanning the line and gets the next group
of characters, @code{dup}. It looks it up in the name dictionary and
(you'll have to take my word for this) finds it, and executes the word
@code{dup} (whatever that means).
@item
Once again, the text interpreter resumes scanning the line and gets the
group of characters @code{fred}. It looks them up in the name
dictionary, but can't find them. It tries to treat them as a number, but
they don't represent any legal number.
@end itemize

At this point, the text interpreter gives up and prints an error
message. The error message shows exactly how far the text interpreter
got in processing the line. In particular, it shows that the text
interpreter made no attempt to do anything with the final character
group, @code{dup}, even though we have good reason to believe that the
text interpreter would have had no problems with looking that word up
and executing it a second time.


@comment ----------------------------------------------
@node Stacks and Postfix notation, Your first definition, Introducing the Text Interpreter, Introduction
@section Stacks, postfix notation and parameter passing
@cindex text interpreter
@cindex outer interpreter

In procedural programming languages (like C and Pascal), the
building-block of programs is the @var{function} or @var{procedure}. These
functions or procedures are called with @var{explicit parameters}. For
example, in C we might write:

@example
total = total + new_volume(length,height,depth);
@end example

@noindent
where new_volume is a function-call to another piece of code, and total,
length, height and depth are all variables. length, height and depth are
parameters to the function-call.

In Forth, the equivalent of the function or procedure is the
@var{definition} and parameters are implicitly passed between
definitions using a shared stack that is visible to the
programmer. Although Forth does support variables, the existence of the
stack means that they are used far less often than in most other
programming languages. When the text interpreter encounters a number, it
will place (@var{push}) it on the stack. There are several stacks (the
actual number is implementation-dependent ..) and the particular stack
used for any operation is implied unambiguously by the operation being
performed. The stack used for all integer operations is called the @var{data
stack} and, since this is the stack used most commonly, references to
``the data stack'' are often abbreviated to ``the stack''.

The stacks have a last-in, first-out (LIFO) organisation. If you type:

@example
@kbd{1 2 3<return>}  ok
@end example

Then this instructs the text interpreter to placed three numbers on the
(data) stack. An analogy for the behaviour of the stack is to take a
pack of playing cards and deal out the ace (1), 2 and 3 into a pile on
the table. The 3 was the last card onto the pile (``last-in'') and if
you take a card off the pile then, unless you're prepared to fiddle a
bit, the card that you take off will be the 3 (``first-out''). The
number that will be first-out of the stack is called the @var{top of
stack}, which
@cindex TOS definition
is often abbreviated to @var{TOS}.

To understand how parameters are passed in Forth, consider the
behaviour of the definition @code{+} (pronounced ``plus''). You will not
be surprised to learn that this definition performs addition. More
precisely, it adds two number together and produces a result. Where does
it get the two numbers from? It takes the top two numbers off the
stack. Where does it place the result? On the stack. You can act-out the
behaviour of @code{+} with your playing cards like this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Pick up two cards from the stack on the table
@item
Stare at them intently and ask yourself ``what @var{is} the sum of these two
numbers''
@item
Decide that the answer is 5
@item
Shuffle the two cards back into the pack and find a 5
@item
Put a 5 on the remaining ace that's on the table.
@end itemize

If you don't have a pack of cards handy but you do have Forth running,
you can use the definition @code{.s} to show the current state of the stack,
without affecting the stack. Type:

@example
@kbd{clearstack 1 2 3<return>} ok
@kbd{.s<return>} <3> 1 2 3  ok
@end example

The text interpreter looks up the word @code{clearstack} and executes
it; it tidies up the stack and removes any entries that may have been
left on it by earlier examples. The text interpreter pushes each of the
three numbers in turn onto the stack. Finally, the text interpreter
looks up the word @code{.s} and executes it. The effect of executing
@code{.s} is to print the ``<3>'' (the total number of items on the stack)
followed by a list of all the items on the stack; the item on the far
right-hand side is the TOS.

You can now type:

@example
@kbd{+ .s<return>} <2> 1 5  ok
@end example

@noindent
which is correct; there are now 2 items on the stack and the result of
the addition is 5.

If you're playing with cards, try doing a second addition: pick up the
two cards, work out that their sum is 6, shuffle them into the pack,
look for a 6 and place that on the table. You now have just one item on
the stack. What happens if you try to do a third addition? Pick up the
first card, pick up the second card -- ah! There is no second card. This
is called a @var{stack underflow} and consitutes an error. If you try to
do the same thing with Forth it will report an error (probably a Stack
Underflow or an Invalid Memory Address error).

The opposite situation to a stack underflow is a @var{stack overflow},
which simply accepts that there is a finite amount of storage space
reserved for the stack. To stretch the playing card analogy, if you had
enough packs of cards and you piled the cards up on the table, you would
eventually be unable to add another card; you'd hit the ceiling. Gforth
allows you to set the maximum size of the stacks. In general, the only
time that you will get a stack overflow is because a definition has a
bug in it and is generating data on the stack uncontrollably.

There's one final use for the playing card analogy. If you model your
stack using a pack of playing cards, the maximum number of items on
your stack will be 52 (I assume you didn't use the Joker). The maximum
@var{value} of any item on the stack is 13 (the King). In fact, the only
possible numbers are positive integer numbers 1 through 13; you can't
have (for example) 0 or 27 or 3.52 or -2. If you change the way you
think about some of the cards, you can accommodate different
numbers. For example, you could think of the Jack as representing 0,
the Queen as representing -1 and the King as representing -2. Your
*range* remains unchanged (you can still only represent a total of 13
numbers) but the numbers that you can represent are -2 through 10.

In that analogy, the limit was the amount of information that a single
stack entry could hold, and Forth has a similar limit. In Forth, the
size of a stack entry is called a @var{cell}. The actual size of a cell is
implementation dependent and affects the maximum value that a stack
entry can hold. A Standard Forth provides a cell size of at least
16-bits, and most desktop systems use a cell size of 32-bits.

Forth does not do any type checking for you, so you are free to
manipulate and combine stack items in any way you wish. A convenient
ways of treating stack items is as 2's complement signed integers, and
that is what Standard words like ``+'' do. Therefore you can type:

@example
@kbd{-5 12 + .s<return>} <1> 7  ok
@end example

If you use numbers and definitions like ``+'' in order to turn Forth
into a great big pocket calculator, you will realise that it's rather
different from a normal calculator. Rather than typing 2 + 3 = you had
to type 2 3 + (ignore the fact that you had to use @code{.s} to see the
result). The terminology used to describe this difference is to say
that your calculator uses @var{Infix Notation} (parameters and operators
are mixed) whilst Forth uses @var{Postfix Notation} (parameters and
operators are separate), also called @var{Reverse Polish Notation}.

Whilst postfix notation might look confusing to begin with, it has
several important advantages:

@itemize @bullet
@item
it is unambiguous
@item
it is more concise
@item
it fits naturally with a stack-based system
@end itemize

To examine these claims in more detail, consider these sums:

@example
6 + 5 * 4 =
4 * 5 + 6 =
@end example

If you're just learning maths or your maths is very rusty, you will
probably come up with the answer 44 for the first and 26 for the
second. If you are a bit of a whizz at maths you will remember the
@var{convention} that multiplication takes precendence over addition, and
you'd come up with the answer 26 both times. To explain the answer 26
to someone who got the answer 44, you'd probably rewrite the first sum
like this:

@example
6 + (5 * 4) =
@end example

If what you really wanted was to perform the addition before the
multiplication, you would have to use parentheses to force it.

If you did the first two sums on a pocket calculator you would probably
get the right answers, unless you were very cautious and entered them using
these keystroke sequences:

6 + 5 = * 4 =
4 * 5 = + 6 =

Postfix notation is unambiguous because the order that the operators
are applied is always explicit; that also means that parentheses are
never required. The operators are @var{active} (the act of quoting the
operator makes the operation occur) which removes the need for ``=''.

The sum 6 + 5 * 4 can be written (in postfix notation) in two
equivalent ways:

@example
6 5 4 * +      or:
5 4 * 6 +
@end example

An important thing that you should notice about this notation is that
the @var{order} of the numbers does not change; if you want to subtract
2 from 10 you type @code{10 2 -}.

The reason that Forth uses postfix notation is very simple to explain: it
makes the implementation extremely simple, and it follows naturally from
using the stack as a mechanism for passing parameters. Another way of
thinking about this is to realise that all Forth definitions are
@var{active}; they execute as they are encountered by the text
interpreter. The result of this is that the syntax of Forth is trivially
simple.



@comment ----------------------------------------------
@node Your first definition, How does that work?, Stacks and Postfix notation, Introduction
@section Your first Forth definition
@cindex first definition

Until now, the examples we've seen have been trivial; we've just been
using Forth an a bigger-than-pocket calculator. Also, each calculation
we've shown has been a ``one-off'' -- to repeat it we'd need to type it in
again@footnote{That's not quite true. If you press the up-arrow key on
your keyboard you should be able to scroll back to any earlier command,
edit it and re-enter it.} In this section we'll see how to add new
word to Forth's vocabulary.

The easiest way to create a new word is to use a @var{colon
definition}. We'll define a few and try them out before we worry too
much about how they work. Try typing in these examples; be careful to
copy the spaces accurately:

@example
: add-two 2 + . ;
: greet ." Hello and welcome" ;
: demo 5 add-two ;
@end example

@noindent
Now try them out:

@example
@kbd{greet<return>} Hello and welcome  ok
@kbd{greet greet<return>} Hello and welcomeHello and welcome  ok
@kbd{4 add-two<return>} 6  ok
@kbd{demo<return>} 7  ok
@kbd{9 greet demo add-two<return>} Hello and welcome7 11  ok
@end example

The first new thing that we've introduced here is the pair of words
@code{:} and @code{;}. These are used to start and terminate a new
definition, respectively. The first word after the @code{:} is the name
for the new definition.

As you can see from the examples, a definition is built up of words that
have already been defined; Forth makes no distinction between
definitions that existed when you started the system up, and those that
you define yourself.

The examples also introduce the words @code{.} (dot), @code{."} (dot-quote)
and @code{dup} (dewp). Dot takes the value from the top of the stack and
displays it. It's like @code{.s} except that it only displays the top
item of the stack and it is destructive; after it has executed the
number is no longer on the top of the stack. There is always one space
printed after the number, and no spaces before it. Dot-quote defines a
string (a sequence of characters) that will be printed when the word is
executed. The string can contain any printable characters except
@code{"}. A @code{"} has a special function; it is not itself a Forth
word but it acts as a delimiter. The way that it works is described in
the next section. Finally, @code{dup} duplicates the value at the top of
the stack. Try typing @code{5 dup .s} to see what it does.

We already know that the text interpreter searches through the
dictionary to locate names. If you've followed the examples earlier, you
will already have a definition called @code{add-two}. Lets try modifying
it by typing in a new definition:

@example
@kbd{: add-two dup . ." + 2 =" 2 + . ;<return>} redefined add-two  ok
@end example

Forth recognised that we were defining a word that already exists, and
printed a message to warn us of that fact. Let's try out the new
definition:

@example
@kbd{9 add-two<return>} 9 + 2 =11  ok
@end example

@noindent
All that we've actually done here, though, is to create a new
definition, with a particular name. The fact that there was already a
definition with the same name did not make any difference to the way
that the new definition was created (except that Forth printed a warning
message). The old definition of add-two still exists (try @code{demo}
again to see that this is true). Any new definition will use the new
definition of @code{add-two}, but old definitions continue to use the
version that already existed at the time that they were @code{compiled}.

Before you go on to the next section, try defining and redefining some
words of your own.

@comment ----------------------------------------------
@node How does that work?, Forth is written in Forth, Your first definition, Introduction
@section How does that work?
@cindex parsing words

Now we're going to take another look at the definition of @code{add-two}
from the previous section. From our knowledge of the way that the text
interpreter works, we would have expected this result when we tried to
define @code{add-two}:

@example
@kbd{: add-two 2 + . " ;<return>}
  ^^^^^^^
Error: Undefined word
@end example

The reason that this didn't happen is bound up in the way that @code{:}
works. The word @code{:} does two special things. The first special
thing that it does prevents the text interpreter from ever seeing the
characters @code{add-two}. The text interpreter uses a variable called
@cindex modifying >IN
@code{>IN} (pronounced ''to-in'') to keep track of where it is in the
input line. When it encounters the word @code{:} it behaves in exactly
the same way as it does for any other word; it looks it up in the name
dictionary, finds its xt and executes it. When @code{:} executes, it
looks at the input buffer, finds the word @code{add-two} and advances the
value of @code{>IN} to point past it. It then does some other stuff
associated with creating the new definition (including creating an entry
for @code{add-two} in the name dictionary). When the execution of @code{:}
completes, control returns to the text interpreter, which is oblivious
to the fact that it has been tricked into ignoring part of the input
line.

Words like @code{:} -- words that advance the value of @code{>IN} and so
prevent the text interpreter from acting on the whole of the input line
-- are called @var{parsing words}.

@cindex state - effect on the text interpreter
@cindex text interpreter - effect of state
The second special thing that @code{:} does is to change the value of a
variable called @code{state}, which affects the way that the text
interpreter behaves. When Gforth starts up, @code{state} has the value
0, and the text interpreter is said to be in @var{interpret}
mode. During a colon definition (started with @code{:}), @code{state} is
set to -1 and the text interpreter is said to be in @var{compile}
mode. The word @code{;} ends the definition -- one of the things that it
does is to change the value of @code{state} back to 0.

When the text interpreter is in @var{interpret} mode, we already know
how it behaves; it looks for each character sequence in the dictionary,
finds its xt and executes it, or it converts it to a number and pushes
it onto the stack, or it fails to do either and generates an error.

When the text interpreter is in @var{compile} mode, its behaviour is
slightly different; it still looks for each character sequence in the
dictionary and finds its xt, or converts it to a number, or fails to do
either and generates an error. However, instead of executing the xt or
pushing the number onto the stack it lays down (@var{compiles}) some
magic to make that xt or number get executed or pushed at a later time;
at the time that @code{add-two} is @var{executed}. Therefore, when you
execute @code{add-two} its @var{run-time effect} is exactly the same as
if you had typed @code{2 + .} outside of a definition, and pressed
carriage-return.

In Forth, every word or number can be described in terms of three
properties:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Its behaviour at @var{compile} time
@item
Its behaviour at @var{interpret} time
@item
Its behaviour at @var{execution} time.
@end itemize

These behaviours are called the @var{semantics} of the word or
number. The value of @var{state} determines whether the text
interpreter will use the compile or interpret semantics of a word or
number that it encounters.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex interpretation semantics
When the text interpreter encounters a word or number in @var{interpret}
state, it performs the @var{interpretation semantics} of the word or
number.
@item
@cindex compilation semantics
When the text interpreter encounters a word or number in @var{compile}
state, it performs the @var{compilation semantics} of the word or
number.
@end itemize

The behaviour of numbers is always the same:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When the number is @var{compiled}, it is appended to the current
definition so that its run-time behaviour is to execute. (In other
words, the compilation semantics of a number are to postpone its
execution semantics until the run-time of the definition that it is
being compiled into.)
@item
When the number is @var{interpreted}, its behaviour is to execute. (In
other words, the interpretation semantics of a number are to perform its
execution semantics.)
@item
@cindex execution semantics
When the number is @var{executed}, its behaviour is to push its value
onto the stack. (In other words, the execution semantics of a number are
to push its value onto the stack.)
@end itemize

The behaviour of a word is not so regular, but the vast majority behave
like this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @var{compilation semantics} of the word are to append its
@var{execution semantics} to the current definition (so that its
run-time behaviour is to execute).
@item
The @var{interpretation semantics} of the word are to execute.
@item
The @var{execution semantics} of the word are to do something useful.
@end itemize


The actual behaviour of any particular word depends upon the way in
which it was defined. In all cases, the text interpreter decides what to
do with the word; when it searches the name dictionary for a definition,
it not only retrieves the xt for the word, it also retrieves a flag
called the @var{immediate flag}. If the flag is set, the text
interpreter will @var{execute} the word rather than @var{compiling}
@cindex immediate words
it. In other words, these so-called @var{immediate} words behave like
this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @var{compilation semantics} of the word are to perform its
@var{execution semantics} (so that its compile-time behaviour is to
execute).
@item
The @var{interpretation semantics} of the word are to execute.
@item
The @var{execution semantics} of the word are to do something useful.
@end itemize

This example shows the difference between an immediate and a
non-immediate word:

@example
: show-state state @ . ;
: show-state-now show-state ; immediate
: word1 show-state ;
: word2 show-state-now ;
@end example

The word @code{immediate} after the definition of @code{show-state-now}
makes that word an immediate word. These definitions introduce a new
word: @code{@@} (pronounced ''at''). This word fetches the value of a
variable, and leaves it on the stack. Therefore, the behaviour of
@code{show-state} is to print a number that represents the current value
of @code{state}.

When you execute @code{word1}, it prints the number 0, indicating
that the system is in interpret state. When the text interpreter
compiled the definition of @code{word1}, it encountered
@code{show-state} whose compilation semantics are to append its
execution semantics to the current definition. When you execute
@code{word1}, it performs the execution semantics of @code{show-state}.
At the time that @code{word1} (and therefore @code{show-state}) are
executed, the system is in interpret state.

When you pressed <return> after entering the definition of @code{word2},
you should have seen the number -1 printed, followed by @code{ ok}. When
the text interpreter compiled the definition of @code{word2}, it
encountered @code{show-state-now}, an immediate word, whose compilation
semantics are therefore to perform its execution semantics. It is
executed straight away (even before the text interpreter has moved on
to process another group of characters; the @code{;} in this
example). The effect of executing it are to display the value of
@code{state} @var{at the time that the definition of} @code{word2}
@var{is being defined}. Printing -1 demonstrates that the system is in
compilation state at this time. If you execute @code{word2} it does
nothing at all.

@cindex @code{."}, how it works
Before leaving the subject of immediate words, consider the behaviour of
@code{."} in the definition of @code{greet}, in the previous
section. This word is both a parsing word and an immediate word. Notice
that there is a space between @code{."} and the start of the text
@code{Hello and welcome}, but that there is no space between the last
letter of @code{welcome} and the @code{"} character. The reason for this
is that @code{."} is a Forth word; it must have a space after it so that
the text interpreter can identify it. The @code{"} is not a Forth word;
it is a @var{delimiter}. The examples earlier show that, when the string
is displayed, there is neither a space before the @code{H} nor after the
@code{e}. Since @code{."} is an immediate word, it executes at the time
that @code{greet} is defined. When it executes, it searches forward in
the input line looking for the delimiter. When it finds the delimiter,
it updates @code{>in} to point past the delimiter. It also compiles some
magic code into the definition of @code{greet}; the xt of a run-time
routine that prints a text string. It compiles the string @code{Hello
and welcome} into memory so that it is available to be printed
later. When the text interpreter gains control, the next word it finds
in the input stream is @code{;} and so it terminates the definition of
@code{greet}.


@comment ----------------------------------------------
@node Forth is written in Forth, Review - elements of a Forth system, How does that work?, Introduction
@section Forth is written in Forth
@cindex structure of Forth programs

When you start up a Forth compiler, a large number of definitions
already exist. In Forth, you develop a new application using bottom-up
programming techniques to create new definitions that are defined in
terms of existing definitions. As you create each definition you can
test and debug it interactively.

If you have tried out the examples in this section, you will probably
have typed them in by hand; when you leave Gforth, your definitions will
be deleted. You can avoid this by using a text editor to enter Forth
source code into a file, and then load all of the code from the file
using @code{include} (@xref{Forth source files}). A Forth source
file is processed by the text interpreter, just as though you had typed
it in by hand@footnote{Actually, there are some subtle differences, like
the fact that it doesn't print @code{ ok} at the end of each line}. 

Gforth also supports the traditional Forth alternative to using text
files for program entry (@xref{Blocks}).

In common with many, if not most, Forth compilers, most of Gforth is
actually written in Forth. All of the @code{.fs} files in the
installation directory are Forth source files, and you can look at them
to see examples of Forth programming.

Gforth maintains a history file that records every line that you
type to the text interpreter. This file is preserved between sessions,
and is used to provide the command-line recall facility. If you enter
long definitions by hand, you can use a text editor to paste them out of
the history file into a Forth source file for reuse at a later time.

@cindex history file
@cindex @file{.gforth-history}
@cindex @code{GFORTHHIST} environment variable
@cindex environment variables
You can find out the name of your history file using @code{history-file
type }. On non-Unix systems you can find the location of the file using
@code{history-dir type }@footnote{The environment variable @code{GFORTHHIST}
determines the location of the file.}

@node Review - elements of a Forth system, Exercises, Forth is written in Forth, Introduction
@section Review - elements of a Forth system
@cindex elements of a Forth system

To summarise this chapter:


@itemize @bullet
@item
Forth programs use @var{factoring} to break a problem down into small
fragments called @var{words} or @var{definitions}.
@item
Forth program development is an interactive process.
@item
The main command loop that accepts input, and controls both
interpretation and compilation, is called the @var{text interpreter}
(also known as the @var{outer interpreter}).
@item
Forth has a very simple syntax, consisting of words and numbers
separated by spaces or carriage-return characters. Any additional syntax
is imposed by @var{parsing words}.
@item
Forth uses a stack to pass parameters between words. As a result, it
uses postfix notation.
@item
To use a word that has previously been defined, the text interpreter
searches for the word in the @var{name dictionary}.
@item
Words have @var{interpretation semantics}, @var{compilation semantics}
and @var{execution semantics}.
@item
The text interpreter uses the value of @code{state} to select between
the use of the @var{interpretation semantics} and the  @var{compilation
semantics} of a word that it encounters.
@item
The relationship between the @var{interpretation semantics}, @var{compilation semantics}
and @var{execution semantics} for a word depend upon the way in which
the word was defined (for example, whether it is an @var{immediate} word).
@item
Forth definitions can be implemented in Forth (called @var{high-level
definitions}) or in some other way (usually a lower-level language and
as a result often called @var{low-level definitions}, @var{code
definitions} or @var{primitives}).
@item
Many Forth systems are implemented mainly in Forth.
@item
You now know enough to read and understand the rest of this manual and
the ANS Forth document.

@cindex elements of a Forth system

Amazing as it may seem, if you have read (and understood) this far, you
know almost all the fundamentals about the inner workings of a Forth
system. You certainly know enough to be able to read and understand the
rest of this manual, to learn more about the facilities that Gforth
provides. Even scarier, you know almost enough to implement your own Forth
system. However, that's not a good idea just yet.. better to try writing
some programs in Gforth.

The large number of Forth words available in ANS Forth and
Gforth make learning Forth somewhat daunting. To make the problem
easier, use the index of this manual to learn more about these words:

..levels of Forth words.


Ideally, provide a set of programming excercises linked into the stuff
done already and into other sections of the manual. Provide solutions to
all the exercises in a .fs file in the distribution. Get some
inspiration from Starting Forth and Kelly&Spies.


@c ******************************************************************
@node Invoking Gforth, Words, Introduction, Top
@chapter Invoking Gforth
@cindex Gforth - invoking
@cindex invoking Gforth
@cindex running Gforth
@cindex command-line options
@cindex options on the command line
@cindex flags on the command line

You will usually just say @code{gforth}. In many other cases the default
Gforth image will be invoked like this:
@example
gforth [files] [-e forth-code]
@end example
This interprets the contents of the files and the Forth code in the order they
are given.

In general, the command line looks like this:

@example
gforth [initialization options] [image-specific options]
@end example

The initialization options must come before the rest of the command
line. They are:

@table @code
@cindex -i, command-line option
@cindex --image-file, command-line option
@item --image-file @var{file}
@itemx -i @var{file}
Loads the Forth image @var{file} instead of the default
@file{gforth.fi} (@pxref{Image Files}).

@cindex --path, command-line option
@cindex -p, command-line option
@item --path @var{path}
@itemx -p @var{path}
Uses @var{path} for searching the image file and Forth source code files
instead of the default in the environment variable @code{GFORTHPATH} or
the path specified at installation time (e.g.,
@file{/usr/local/share/gforth/0.2.0:.}). A path is given as a list of
directories, separated by @samp{:} (on Unix) or @samp{;} (on other OSs).

@cindex --dictionary-size, command-line option
@cindex -m, command-line option
@cindex @var{size} parameters for command-line options
@cindex size of the dictionary and the stacks
@item --dictionary-size @var{size}
@itemx -m @var{size}
Allocate @var{size} space for the Forth dictionary space instead of
using the default specified in the image (typically 256K). The
@var{size} specification for this and subsequent options consists of
an integer and a unit (e.g.,
@code{4M}). The unit can be one of @code{b} (bytes), @code{e} (element
size, in this case Cells), @code{k} (kilobytes), @code{M} (Megabytes),
@code{G} (Gigabytes), and @code{T} (Terabytes). If no unit is specified,
@code{e} is used.

@cindex --data-stack-size, command-line option
@cindex -d, command-line option
@item --data-stack-size @var{size}
@itemx -d @var{size}
Allocate @var{size} space for the data stack instead of using the
default specified in the image (typically 16K).

@cindex --return-stack-size, command-line option
@cindex -r, command-line option
@item --return-stack-size @var{size}
@itemx -r @var{size}
Allocate @var{size} space for the return stack instead of using the
default specified in the image (typically 15K).

@cindex --fp-stack-size, command-line option
@cindex -f, command-line option
@item --fp-stack-size @var{size}
@itemx -f @var{size}
Allocate @var{size} space for the floating point stack instead of
using the default specified in the image (typically 15.5K). In this case
the unit specifier @code{e} refers to floating point numbers.

@cindex --locals-stack-size, command-line option
@cindex -l, command-line option
@item --locals-stack-size @var{size}
@itemx -l @var{size}
Allocate @var{size} space for the locals stack instead of using the
default specified in the image (typically 14.5K).

@cindex -h, command-line option
@cindex --help, command-line option
@item --help
@itemx -h
Print a message about the command-line options

@cindex -v, command-line option
@cindex --version, command-line option
@item --version
@itemx -v
Print version and exit

@cindex --debug, command-line option
@item --debug
Print some information useful for debugging on startup.

@cindex --offset-image, command-line option
@item --offset-image
Start the dictionary at a slightly different position than would be used
otherwise (useful for creating data-relocatable images,
@pxref{Data-Relocatable Image Files}).

@cindex --no-offset-im, command-line option
@item --no-offset-im
Start the dictionary at the normal position.

@cindex --clear-dictionary, command-line option
@item --clear-dictionary
Initialize all bytes in the dictionary to 0 before loading the image
(@pxref{Data-Relocatable Image Files}).

@cindex --die-on-signal, command-line-option
@item --die-on-signal
Normally Gforth handles most signals (e.g., the user interrupt SIGINT,
or the segmentation violation SIGSEGV) by translating it into a Forth
@code{THROW}. With this option, Gforth exits if it receives such a
signal. This option is useful when the engine and/or the image might be
severely broken (such that it causes another signal before recovering
from the first); this option avoids endless loops in such cases.
@end table

@cindex loading files at startup
@cindex executing code on startup
@cindex batch processing with Gforth
As explained above, the image-specific command-line arguments for the
default image @file{gforth.fi} consist of a sequence of filenames and
@code{-e @var{forth-code}} options that are interpreted in the sequence
in which they are given. The @code{-e @var{forth-code}} or
@code{--evaluate @var{forth-code}} option evaluates the Forth
code. This option takes only one argument; if you want to evaluate more
Forth words, you have to quote them or use @code{-e} several times. To exit
after processing the command line (instead of entering interactive mode)
append @code{-e bye} to the command line.

@cindex versions, invoking other versions of Gforth
If you have several versions of Gforth installed, @code{gforth} will
invoke the version that was installed last. @code{gforth-@var{version}}
invokes a specific version. You may want to use the option
@code{--path}, if your environment contains the variable
@code{GFORTHPATH}.

Not yet implemented:
On startup the system first executes the system initialization file
(unless the option @code{--no-init-file} is given; note that the system
resulting from using this option may not be ANS Forth conformant). Then
the user initialization file @file{.gforth.fs} is executed, unless the
option @code{--no-rc} is given; this file is first searched in @file{.},
then in @file{~}, then in the normal path (see above).


@cindex Gforth - leaving
@cindex leaving Gforth

You can leave Gforth by typing @code{bye} or (if you invoked Gforth with
the @code{--die-on-signal} option) Ctrl-C. When you leave Gforth, all of
your definitions and data are discarded. @xref{Image Files} for ways
of saving the state of the system before leaving Gforth.

@node Notation, Comments, Words, Words
@section Notation
@cindex notation of glossary entries
@cindex format of glossary entries
@cindex glossary notation format
@cindex word glossary entry format

The Forth words are described in this section in the glossary notation
that has become a de-facto standard for Forth texts, i.e.,

@format
@var{word}     @var{Stack effect}   @var{wordset}   @var{pronunciation}
@end format
@var{Description}

@table @var
@item word
@cindex case-sensitivity
The name of the word. Gforth is case-insensitive, so you can type the
words in in lower case (However, @pxref{core-idef,
Implementation-defined options, Implementation-defined options}).

@item Stack effect
@cindex stack effect
The stack effect is written in the notation @code{@var{before} --
@var{after}}, where @var{before} and @var{after} describe the top of
stack entries before and after the execution of the word. The rest of
the stack is not touched by the word. The top of stack is rightmost,
i.e., a stack sequence is written as it is typed in. Note that Gforth
uses a separate floating point stack, but a unified stack
notation. Also, return stack effects are not shown in @var{stack
effect}, but in @var{Description}. The name of a stack item describes
the type and/or the function of the item. See below for a discussion of
the types.

All words have two stack effects: A compile-time stack effect and a
run-time stack effect. The compile-time stack-effect of most words is
@var{ -- }. If the compile-time stack-effect of a word deviates from
this standard behaviour, or the word does other unusual things at
compile time, both stack effects are shown; otherwise only the run-time
stack effect is shown.

@cindex pronounciation of words
@item pronunciation
How the word is pronounced.

@cindex wordset
@item wordset
The ANS Forth standard is divided into several word sets. A standard
system need not support all of them. Therefore, in theory, the fewer
word sets your program uses the more portable it will be. However, we
suspect that most ANS Forth systems on personal machines will feature
all word sets. Words that are not defined in ANS Forth have
@code{gforth} or @code{gforth-internal} as word set. @code{gforth}
describes words that will work in future releases of Gforth;
@code{gforth-internal} words are more volatile. Environmental query
strings are also displayed like words; you can recognize them by the
@code{environment} in the word set field.

@item Description
A description of the behaviour of the word.

@cindex division with potentially negative operands
Forth arithmetic is not checked, i.e., you will not hear about integer
overflow on addition or multiplication, you may hear about division by
zero if you are lucky. The operator is written after the operands, but
the operands are still in the original order. I.e., the infix @code{2-1}
corresponds to @code{2 1 -}. Forth offers a variety of division
operators. If you perform division with potentially negative operands,
you do not want to use @code{/} or @code{/mod} with its undefined
behaviour, but rather @code{fm/mod} or @code{sm/mod} (probably the
former, @pxref{Mixed precision}).

@cindex double precision arithmetic words

@xref{Number Conversion} for the rules used by the text interpreter for
recognising double-precision integers.

A double precision number is represented by a cell pair, with the most
significant digit at the TOS. It is trivial to convert an unsigned
single to an (unsigned) double; simply push a @code{0} onto the
TOS. Since numbers are represented by Gforth using 2's complement
arithmetic, converting a signed single to a (signed) double requires
sign-extension across the most significant digit. This can be achieved
using @code{s>d}. The moral of the story is that you cannot convert a
number without knowing whether it represents an unsigned or a
signed number.

@node Stack Manipulation, Memory, Arithmetic, Words
@section Stack Manipulation
@cindex stack manipulation words

@cindex floating-point stack in the standard
Gforth maintains a number of separate stacks:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A data stack (aka parameter stack) -- for characters, cells,
addresses, and double cells.

@item
A floating point stack -- for floating point numbers.

@item
A return stack -- for storing the return addresses of colon
definitions and other data.

@item
A locals stack for storing local variables.
@end itemize

Whilst every sane Forth has a separate floating-point stack, it is not
strictly required; an ANS Forth system could theoretically keep
floating-point numbers on the data stack. As an additional difficulty,
you don't know how many cells a floating-point number takes. It is
reportedly possible to write words in a way that they work also for a
unified stack model, but we do not recommend trying it. Instead, just
say that your program has an environmental dependency on a separate
floating-point stack.

doc-floating-stack

@cindex return stack and locals
@cindex locals and return stack
A Forth system is allowed to keep local variables on the
return stack. This is reasonable, as local variables usually eliminate
the need to use the return stack explicitly. So, if you want to produce
a standard compliant program and you are using local variables in a
word, forget about return stack manipulations in that word (refer to the
standard document for the exact rules).

@node Address arithmetic, Memory Blocks, Memory Access, Memory
@subsection Address arithmetic
@cindex address arithmetic words

ANS Forth does not specify the sizes of the data types. Instead, it
offers a number of words for computing sizes and doing address
arithmetic. Basically, address arithmetic is performed in terms of
address units (aus); on most systems the address unit is one byte. Note
that a character may have more than one au, so @code{chars} is no noop
(on systems where it is a noop, it compiles to nothing).

@cindex alignment of addresses for types
ANS Forth also defines words for aligning addresses for specific
types. Many computers require that accesses to specific data types
must only occur at specific addresses; e.g., that cells may only be
accessed at addresses divisible by 4. Even if a machine allows unaligned
accesses, it can usually perform aligned accesses faster. 

For the performance-conscious: alignment operations are usually only
necessary during the definition of a data structure, not during the
(more frequent) accesses to it.

ANS Forth defines no words for character-aligning addresses. This is not
an oversight, but reflects the fact that addresses that are not
char-aligned have no use in the standard and therefore will not be
created.

@cindex @code{CREATE} and alignment
AND Forth guarantees that addresses returned by @code{CREATE}d words
are cell-aligned; in addition, Gforth guarantees that these addresses
are aligned for all purposes.

Note that the ANS Forth word @code{char} has nothing to do with address
arithmetic.

@subsection Memory Blocks
@cindex memory block words

Some of these words work on address units (increments of @code{CELL}),
and expect a @code{CELL}-aligned address. Others work on character units
(increments of @code{CHAR}), and expect a @code{CHAR}-aligned
address. Choose the correct operation depending upon your data type. If
you are moving a block of memory (for example, a region reserved by
@code{allot}) it is safe to use @code{move}, and it should be faster
than using @code{cmove}. If you are moving (for example) a string
compiled using @code{S"}, it is not portable to use @code{move}; the
alignment of the string in memory could change, and the relationship
between @code{CELL} and @code{CHAR} could change.

When copying characters between overlapping memory regions, choose
carefully between @code{cmove} and @code{cmove>}.

You can only use any of these words @var{portably} to access data space.

@cindex control structures

Control structures in Forth cannot be used in interpret state, only in
compile state@footnote{More precisely, they have no interpretation
semantics (@pxref{Interpretation and Compilation Semantics})}, i.e., in
a colon definition. We do not like this limitation, but have not seen a
satisfying way around it yet, although many schemes have been proposed.

or
@example

IF
  @var{code1}
ELSE
  @var{code2}
ENDIF
@end example

You can use @code{THEN} instead of @code{ENDIF}. Indeed, @code{THEN} is
standard, and @code{ENDIF} is not, although it is quite popular. We
recommend using @code{ENDIF}, because it is less confusing for people
who also know other languages (and is not prone to reinforcing negative
prejudices against Forth in these people). Adding @code{ENDIF} to a
system that only supplies @code{THEN} is simple:
@example
: ENDIF   POSTPONE THEN ; immediate
@end example

[According to @cite{Webster's New Encyclopedic Dictionary}, @dfn{then
(adv.)}  has the following meanings:
@quotation
... 2b: following next after in order ... 3d: as a necessary consequence
(if you were there, then you saw them).
@end quotation
Forth's @code{THEN} has the meaning 2b, whereas @code{THEN} in Pascal
and many other programming languages has the meaning 3d.]

Gforth also provides the words @code{?DUP-IF} and @code{?DUP-0=-IF}, so
you can avoid using @code{?dup}. Using these alternatives is also more
efficient than using @code{?dup}. Definitions in ANS Forth
for @code{ENDIF}, @code{?DUP-IF} and @code{?DUP-0=-IF} are provided in
@file{compat/control.fs}.

@cindex @code{CASE} control structure
@example
@var{n}
CASE
  @var{n1} OF @var{code1} ENDOF
  @var{n2} OF @var{code2} ENDOF
  @dots{}
ENDCASE
@end example

Executes the first @var{codei}, where the @var{ni} is equal to
@var{n}. A default case can be added by simply writing the code after
the last @code{ENDOF}. It may use @var{n}, which is on top of the stack,
but must not consume it.

@cindex @code{UNTIL} loop

@node Counted Loops, Arbitrary control structures, Simple Loops, Control Structures
@subsection Counted Loops
@cindex counted loops
@cindex loops, counted
@cindex @code{DO} loops

The basic counted loop is:
@example
@var{limit} @var{start}
?DO
  @var{body}
LOOP
@end example

This performs one iteration for every integer, starting from @var{start}
and up to, but excluding @var{limit}. The counter, or @var{index}, can be
accessed with @code{i}. For example, the loop:
@example
10 0 ?DO
  i .
LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}

The index of the innermost loop can be accessed with @code{i}, the index
of the next loop with @code{j}, and the index of the third loop with
@code{k}.

doc-i
doc-j
doc-k

The loop control data are kept on the return stack, so there are some
restrictions on mixing return stack accesses and counted loop words. In
particuler, if you put values on the return stack outside the loop, you
cannot read them inside the loop@footnote{well, not in a way that is
portable.}. If you put values on the return stack within a loop, you
have to remove them before the end of the loop and before accessing the
index of the loop.

There are several variations on the counted loop:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{LEAVE} leaves the innermost counted loop immediately; execution
continues after the associated @code{LOOP} or @code{NEXT}. For example:

@example
10 0 ?DO  i DUP . 3 = IF LEAVE THEN LOOP
@end example
prints @code{0 1 2 3}


@item
@code{UNLOOP} prepares for an abnormal loop exit, e.g., via
@code{EXIT}. @code{UNLOOP} removes the loop control parameters from the
return stack so @code{EXIT} can get to its return address. For example:

@example
: demo 10 0 ?DO i DUP . 3 = IF UNLOOP EXIT THEN LOOP ." Done" ;
@end example
prints @code{0 1 2 3}


@item
If @var{start} is greater than @var{limit}, a @code{?DO} loop is entered
(and @code{LOOP} iterates until they become equal by wrap-around
arithmetic). This behaviour is usually not what you want. Therefore,
Gforth offers @code{+DO} and @code{U+DO} (as replacements for
@code{?DO}), which do not enter the loop if @var{start} is greater than
@var{limit}; @code{+DO} is for signed loop parameters, @code{U+DO} for
unsigned loop parameters.

@item
@code{?DO} can be replaced by @code{DO}. @code{DO} always enters
the loop, independent of the loop parameters. Do not use @code{DO}, even
if you know that the loop is entered in any case. Such knowledge tends
to become invalid during maintenance of a program, and then the
@code{DO} will make trouble.

@item
@code{LOOP} can be replaced with @code{@var{n} +LOOP}; this updates the
index by @var{n} instead of by 1. The loop is terminated when the border
between @var{limit-1} and @var{limit} is crossed. E.g.:

@example
4 0 +DO  i .  2 +LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0 2}

@example
4 1 +DO  i .  2 +LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{1 3}


@cindex negative increment for counted loops
@cindex counted loops with negative increment
The behaviour of @code{@var{n} +LOOP} is peculiar when @var{n} is negative:

@example
-1 0 ?DO  i .  -1 +LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0 -1}

@example
0 0 ?DO  i .  -1 +LOOP
@end example
prints nothing.

Therefore we recommend avoiding @code{@var{n} +LOOP} with negative
@var{n}. One alternative is @code{@var{u} -LOOP}, which reduces the
index by @var{u} each iteration. The loop is terminated when the border
between @var{limit+1} and @var{limit} is crossed. Gforth also provides
@code{-DO} and @code{U-DO} for down-counting loops. E.g.:

@example
-2 0 -DO  i .  1 -LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0 -1}

@example
-1 0 -DO  i .  1 -LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints @code{0}

@example
0 0 -DO  i .  1 -LOOP
@end example
@noindent
prints nothing.

@end itemize

Unfortunately, @code{+DO}, @code{U+DO}, @code{-DO}, @code{U-DO} and
@code{-LOOP} are not defined in ANS Forth. However, an implementation
for these words that uses only standard words is provided in
@file{compat/loops.fs}.


@cindex @code{FOR} loops
Another counted loop is:
@example
@var{n}
FOR
  @var{body}
NEXT
@end example
This is the preferred loop of native code compiler writers who are too
lazy to optimize @code{?DO} loops properly. This loop structure is not
defined in ANS Forth. In Gforth, this loop iterates @var{n+1} times;
@code{i} produces values starting with @var{n} and ending with 0. Other
Forth systems may behave differently, even if they support @code{FOR}
loops. To avoid problems, don't use @code{FOR} loops.

@node Arbitrary control structures, Calls and returns, Counted Loops, Control Structures
@subsection Arbitrary control structures
@cindex control structures, user-defined

@cindex control-flow stack
ANS Forth permits and supports using control structures in a non-nested
way. Information about incomplete control structures is stored on the
control-flow stack. This stack may be implemented on the Forth data
stack, and this is what we have done in Gforth.

@cindex @code{orig}, control-flow stack item
@cindex @code{dest}, control-flow stack item
An @i{orig} entry represents an unresolved forward branch, a @i{dest}
entry represents a backward branch target. A few words are the basis for
building any control structure possible (except control structures that
need storage, like calls, coroutines, and backtracking).

doc-if
doc-ahead
doc-then
doc-begin
doc-until
doc-again
doc-cs-pick
doc-cs-roll

The Standard words @code{CS-PICK} and @code{CS-ROLL} allow you to
manipulate the control-flow stack in a portable way. Without them, you
would need to know how many stack items are occupied by a control-flow
entry (many systems use one cell. In Gforth they currently take three,
but this may change in the future).

Some standard control structure words are built from these words:

doc-else
doc-while
doc-repeat

Gforth adds some more control-structure words:

doc-endif
doc-?dup-if
doc-?dup-0=-if

Counted loop words constitute a separate group of words:

doc-?do
doc-+do
doc-u+do
doc--do
doc-u-do
doc-do
doc-for
doc-loop
doc-+loop
doc--loop
doc-next
doc-leave
doc-?leave
doc-unloop
doc-done

The standard does not allow using @code{CS-PICK} and @code{CS-ROLL} on
@i{do-sys}. Gforth allows it, but it's your job to ensure that for
every @code{?DO} etc. there is exactly one @code{UNLOOP} on any path
through the definition (@code{LOOP} etc. compile an @code{UNLOOP} on the
fall-through path). Also, you have to ensure that all @code{LEAVE}s are
resolved (by using one of the loop-ending words or @code{DONE}).

Another group of control structure words are:

doc-case
doc-endcase
doc-of
doc-endof

@i{case-sys} and @i{of-sys} cannot be processed using @code{CS-PICK} and
@code{CS-ROLL}.

@subsubsection Programming Style

In order to ensure readability we recommend that you do not create
arbitrary control structures directly, but define new control structure
words for the control structure you want and use these words in your
program. For example, instead of writing:

@example
BEGIN
  ...
IF [ 1 CS-ROLL ]
  ...
AGAIN THEN
@end example

@noindent
we recommend defining control structure words, e.g.,

@example
: WHILE ( DEST -- ORIG DEST )
 POSTPONE IF
 1 CS-ROLL ; immediate

: REPEAT ( orig dest -- )
 POSTPONE AGAIN
 POSTPONE THEN ; immediate
@end example

@noindent
and then using these to create the control structure:

@example
BEGIN
  ...
WHILE
  ...
REPEAT
@end example

That's much easier to read, isn't it? Of course, @code{REPEAT} and
@code{WHILE} are predefined, so in this example it would not be
necessary to define them.

@subsection Calls and returns

@cindex recursive definitions
A definition can be called simply be writing the name of the definition
to be called. Normally a definition is invisible during its own
definition. If you want to write a directly recursive definition, you
can use @code{recursive} to make the current definition visible, or
@code{recurse} to call the current definition directly.

doc-recursive

@comment TODO add example of the two recursion methods
@quotation
@progstyle
I prefer using @code{recursive} to @code{recurse}, because calling the
definition by name is more descriptive (if the name is well-chosen) than
the somewhat cryptic @code{recurse}.  E.g., in a quicksort
implementation, it is much better to read (and think) ``now sort the
partitions'' than to read ``now do a recursive call''.
@end quotation

@comment TODO maybe move deferred words to Defining Words section and x-ref
@comment from here.. that is where these two are glossed.

For mutual recursion, use @code{defer}red words, like this:

@example
defer foo

: bar ( ... -- ... )
 ... foo ... ;

:noname ( ... -- ... )
 ... bar ... ;
IS foo
@end example

The current definition returns control to the calling definition when
the end of the definition is reached or @code{EXIT} is encountered.

@node Exception Handling,  , Calls and returns, Control Structures
@subsection Exception Handling
@cindex exceptions

If your program detects a fatal error condition, the simplest action
that it can take is to @code{quit}. This resets the return stack and
restarts the text interpreter, but does not print any error message.

The next stage in severity is to execute @code{abort}, which has the
same effect as @code{quit}, with the addition that it resets the data
stack.

A slightly more sophisticated approach is use use @code{abort"}, which
compiles a string to be used as an error message and does a conditional
@code{abort} at run-time. For example:

@example
@kbd{: checker abort" That flag was true" ." A false flag" ;<return>}  ok
@kbd{0 checker<return>} A false flag ok
@kbd{1 checker<return>}
:1: That flag was true
1 checker
  ^^^^^^^
$400D1648 throw 
$400E4660
@end example

These simple techniques allow a program to react to a fatal error
condition, but they are not exactly user-friendly. The ANS Forth
Exception word set provides the pair of words @code{throw} and
@code{catch}, which can be used to provide sophisticated error-handling.

@code{catch} has a similar behaviour to @code{execute}, in that it takes
an @var{xt} as a parameter and starts execution of the xt. However,
before passing control to the xt, @code{catch} pushes an
@var{exception frame} onto the @var{exception stack}. This exception
frame is used to restore the system to a known state if a detected error
occurs during the execution of the xt. A typical way to use @code{catch}
would be:

@example
... ['] foo catch IF ...
@end example

Whilst @code{foo} executes, it can call other words to any level of
nesting, as usual.  If @code{foo} (and all the words that it calls)
execute successfully, control will ultimately passes to the word following
the @code{catch}, and there will be a @code{true} flag (0) at
TOS. However, if any word detects an error, it can terminate the
execution of @code{foo} by pushing an error code onto the stack and then
performing a @code{throw}. The execution of @code{throw} will pass 
control to the word following the @code{catch}, but this time the TOS
will hold the error code. Therefore, the @code{IF} in the example
can be used to determine whether @code{foo} executed successfully.

This simple example shows how you can use @code{throw} and @code{catch}
to ``take over'' exception handling from the system:
@example
: my-div ['] / catch if ." DIVIDE ERROR" else ." OK.. " . then ;
@end example

The next example is more sophisticated and shows a multi-level
@code{throw} and @code{catch}. To understand this example, start at the
definition of @code{top-level} and work backwards:

@example
: lowest-level ( -- c )
    key dup 27 = if
	1 throw \ ESCAPE key pressed
    else
	." lowest-level successfull" CR
    then
;

: lower-level ( -- c )
    lowest-level
    \ at this level consider a CTRL-U to be a fatal error
    dup 21 = if \ CTRL-U
	2 throw
    else
	." lower-level successfull" CR
    then
;

: low-level ( -- c )
    ['] lower-level catch
    ?dup if
	\ error occurred - do we recognise it?
	dup 1 = if
	    \ ESCAPE key pressed.. pretend it was an E
	    [char] E
	else throw \ propogate the error upwards
	then
    then
    ." low-level successfull" CR
;

: top-level ( -- )
    CR ['] low-level catch \ CATCH is used like EXECUTE
    ?dup if \ error occurred..
	." Error " . ." occurred - contact your supplier"
    else
	." The '" emit ." ' key was pressed" CR
    then
;
@end example

The ANS Forth document assigns @code{throw} codes thus:

@node User-defined Defining Words, Supplying names, Colon Definitions, Defining Words
@subsection User-defined Defining Words
@cindex user-defined defining words
@cindex defining words, user-defined

You can create new defining words simply by wrapping defining-time code
around existing defining words and putting the sequence in a colon
definition.

@comment TODO example

@cindex @code{CREATE} ... @code{DOES>}
If you want the words defined with your defining words to behave
differently from words defined with standard defining words, you can
write your defining word like this:

@example
: def-word ( "name" -- )
    Create @var{code1}
DOES> ( ... -- ... )
    @var{code2} ;

def-word name
@end example

Technically, this fragment defines a defining word @code{def-word}, and
a word @code{name}; when you execute @code{name}, the address of the
body of @code{name} is put on the data stack and @var{code2} is executed
(the address of the body of @code{name} is the address @code{HERE}
returns immediately after the @code{CREATE}). The word @code{name} is
sometimes called a @var{child} of @code{def-word}.

In other words, if you make the following definitions:

@example
: def-word1 ( "name" -- )
    Create @var{code1} ;

: action1 ( ... -- ... )
    @var{code2} ;

def-word name1
@end example

Using @code{name1 action1} is equivalent to using @code{name}.

The classic example is that you can define @code{Constant} in this way:

@example
: constant ( w "name" -- )
    create ,
DOES> ( -- w )
    @@ ;
@end example

@comment that is the classic example.. maybe it should be earlier. There
@comment is a beautiful description of how this works and what it does in
@comment the Forthwrite 100th edition.

When you create a constant with @code{5 constant five}, first a new word
@code{five} is created, then the value 5 is laid down in the body of
@code{five} with @code{,}. When @code{five} is invoked, the address of
the body is put on the stack, and @code{@@} retrieves the value 5.

@cindex stack effect of @code{DOES>}-parts
@cindex @code{DOES>}-parts, stack effect
In the example above the stack comment after the @code{DOES>} specifies
the stack effect of the defined words, not the stack effect of the
following code (the following code expects the address of the body on
the top of stack, which is not reflected in the stack comment). This is
the convention that I use and recommend (it clashes a bit with using
locals declarations for stack effect specification, though).

@subsubsection Applications of @code{CREATE..DOES>}
@cindex @code{CREATE} ... @code{DOES>}, applications

You may wonder how to use this feature. Here are some usage patterns:

@cindex factoring similar colon definitions
When you see a sequence of code occurring several times, and you can
identify a meaning, you will factor it out as a colon definition. When
you see similar colon definitions, you can factor them using
@code{CREATE..DOES>}. E.g., an assembler usually defines several words
that look very similar:
@example
: ori, ( reg-target reg-source n -- )
    0 asm-reg-reg-imm ;
: andi, ( reg-target reg-source n -- )
    1 asm-reg-reg-imm ;
@end example

@noindent
This could be factored with:
@example
: reg-reg-imm ( op-code -- )
    CREATE ,
DOES> ( reg-target reg-source n -- )
    @@ asm-reg-reg-imm ;

0 reg-reg-imm ori,
1 reg-reg-imm andi,
@end example

@cindex currying
Another view of @code{CREATE..DOES>} is to consider it as a crude way to
supply a part of the parameters for a word (known as @dfn{currying} in
the functional language community). E.g., @code{+} needs two
parameters. Creating versions of @code{+} with one parameter fixed can
be done like this:
@example
: curry+ ( n1 -- )
    CREATE ,
DOES> ( n2 -- n1+n2 )
    @@ + ;

 3 curry+ 3+
-2 curry+ 2-
@end example

@subsubsection The gory details of @code{CREATE..DOES>}
@cindex @code{CREATE} ... @code{DOES>}, details

doc-does>

@cindex @code{DOES>} in a separate definition
This means that you need not use @code{CREATE} and @code{DOES>} in the
same definition; you can put the @code{DOES>}-part in a separate
definition. This allows us to, e.g., select among different DOES>-parts:
@example
: does1 
DOES> ( ... -- ... )
    ... ;

: does2
DOES> ( ... -- ... )
    ... ;

: def-word ( ... -- ... )
    create ...
    IF
       does1
    ELSE
       does2
    ENDIF ;
@end example

In this example, the selection of whether to use @code{does1} or
@code{does2} is made at compile-time; at the time that the child word is
@code{Create}d.

@cindex @code{DOES>} in interpretation state
In a standard program you can apply a @code{DOES>}-part only if the last
word was defined with @code{CREATE}. In Gforth, the @code{DOES>}-part
will override the behaviour of the last word defined in any case. In a
standard program, you can use @code{DOES>} only in a colon
definition. In Gforth, you can also use it in interpretation state, in a
kind of one-shot mode; for example:
@example
CREATE name ( ... -- ... )
  @var{initialization}
DOES>
  @var{code} ;
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to the standard:
@example
:noname
DOES>
    @var{code} ;
CREATE name EXECUTE ( ... -- ... )
    @var{initialization}
@end example

You can get the address of the body of a word with:

doc->body

@node Supplying names, Interpretation and Compilation Semantics, User-defined Defining Words, Defining Words
@subsection Supplying names for the defined words
@cindex names for defined words
@cindex defining words, name parameter

@cindex defining words, name given in a string
By default, defining words take the names for the defined words from the
input stream. Sometimes you want to supply the name from a string. You
can do this with:

doc-nextname

For example:

@example
s" foo" nextname create
@end example
@noindent
is equivalent to:
@example
create foo
@end example

@cindex defining words without name
Sometimes you want to define an @var{anonymous word}; a word without a
name. You can do this with:

doc-:noname

This leaves the execution token for the word on the stack after the
closing @code{;}. Here's an example in which a deferred word is
initialised with an @code{xt} from an anonymous colon definition:
@example
Defer deferred
:noname ( ... -- ... )
  ... ;
IS deferred
@end example

Gforth provides an alternative way of doing this, using two separate
words:

doc-noname
@cindex execution token of last defined word
doc-lastxt

The previous example can be rewritten using @code{noname} and
@code{lastxt}:

@example
Defer deferred
noname : ( ... -- ... )
  ... ;
lastxt IS deferred
@end example

@code{lastxt} also works when the last word was not defined as
@code{noname}. 


@node Interpretation and Compilation Semantics,  , Supplying names, Defining Words
@subsection Interpretation and Compilation Semantics
@cindex semantics, interpretation and compilation

@cindex interpretation semantics
The @dfn{interpretation semantics} of a word are what the text
interpreter does when it encounters the word in interpret state. It also
appears in some other contexts, e.g., the execution token returned by
@code{' @var{word}} identifies the interpretation semantics of
@var{word} (in other words, @code{' @var{word} execute} is equivalent to
interpret-state text interpretation of @code{@var{word}}).

@cindex compilation semantics
The @dfn{compilation semantics} of a word are what the text interpreter
does when it encounters the word in compile state. It also appears in
other contexts, e.g, @code{POSTPONE @var{word}} compiles@footnote{In
standard terminology, ``appends to the current definition''.} the
compilation semantics of @var{word}.

@cindex execution semantics
The standard also talks about @dfn{execution semantics}. They are used
only for defining the interpretation and compilation semantics of many
words. By default, the interpretation semantics of a word are to
@code{execute} its execution semantics, and the compilation semantics of
a word are to @code{compile,} its execution semantics.@footnote{In
standard terminology: The default interpretation semantics are its
execution semantics; the default compilation semantics are to append its
execution semantics to the execution semantics of the current
definition.}

@comment TODO expand, make it co-operate with new sections on text interpreter.

@cindex immediate words
@cindex compile-only words
You can change the semantics of the most-recently defined word:

doc-immediate
doc-compile-only
doc-restrict

Note that ticking (@code{'}) a compile-only word gives an error
(``Interpreting a compile-only word'').

Gforth also allows you to define words with arbitrary combinations of
interpretation and compilation semantics.

doc-interpret/compile:

This feature was introduced for implementing @code{TO} and @code{S"}. I
recommend that you do not define such words, as cute as they may be:
they make it hard to get at both parts of the word in some contexts.
E.g., assume you want to get an execution token for the compilation
part. Instead, define two words, one that embodies the interpretation
part, and one that embodies the compilation part.  Once you have done
that, you can define a combined word with @code{interpret/compile:} for
the convenience of your users.

You might try to use this feature to provide an optimizing
implementation of the default compilation semantics of a word. For
example, by defining:
@example
:noname
   foo bar ;
:noname
   POSTPONE foo POSTPONE bar ;
interpret/compile: foobar
@end example

@noindent
as an optimizing version of:

@example
: foobar
    foo bar ;
@end example

Unfortunately, this does not work correctly with @code{[compile]},
because @code{[compile]} assumes that the compilation semantics of all
@code{interpret/compile:} words are non-default. I.e., @code{[compile]
foobar} would compile the compilation semantics for the optimizing
@code{foobar}, whereas it would compile the interpretation semantics for
the non-optimizing @code{foobar}.

@cindex state-smart words (are a bad idea)
Some people try to use @var{state-smart} words to emulate the feature provided
by @code{interpret/compile:} (words are state-smart if they check
@code{STATE} during execution). E.g., they would try to code
@code{foobar} like this:

@example
: foobar
  STATE @@
  IF ( compilation state )
    POSTPONE foo POSTPONE bar
  ELSE
    foo bar
  ENDIF ; immediate
@end example

Although this works if @code{foobar} is only processed by the text
interpreter, it does not work in other contexts (like @code{'} or
@code{POSTPONE}). E.g., @code{' foobar} will produce an execution token
for a state-smart word, not for the interpretation semantics of the
original @code{foobar}; when you execute this execution token (directly
with @code{EXECUTE} or indirectly through @code{COMPILE,}) in compile
state, the result will not be what you expected (i.e., it will not
perform @code{foo bar}). State-smart words are a bad idea. Simply don't
write them@footnote{For a more detailed discussion of this topic, see
@cite{@code{State}-smartness -- Why it is Evil and How to Exorcise it} by Anton
Ertl; presented at EuroForth '98 and available from
@url{http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/papers/}}!

@cindex defining words with arbitrary semantics combinations
It is also possible to write defining words that define words with
arbitrary combinations of interpretation and compilation semantics. In
general, they look like this:

@example
: def-word
    create-interpret/compile
    @var{code1}
interpretation>
    @var{code2}
<interpretation
compilation>
    @var{code3}
<compilation ;
@end example

For a @var{word} defined with @code{def-word}, the interpretation
semantics are to push the address of the body of @var{word} and perform
@var{code2}, and the compilation semantics are to push the address of
the body of @var{word} and perform @var{code3}. E.g., @code{constant}
can also be defined like this (except that the defined constants don't
behave correctly when @code{[compile]}d):

@example
: constant ( n "name" -- )
    create-interpret/compile
    ,
interpretation> ( -- n )
    @@
<interpretation
compilation> ( compilation. -- ; run-time. -- n )
    @@ postpone literal
<compilation ;
@end example

doc-create-interpret/compile
doc-interpretation>
doc-<interpretation
doc-compilation>
doc-<compilation

Note that words defined with @code{interpret/compile:} and
@code{create-interpret/compile} have an extended header structure that
differs from other words; however, unless you try to access them with
plain address arithmetic, you should not notice this. Words for
accessing the header structure usually know how to deal with this; e.g.,
@code{' word >body} also gives you the body of a word created with
@code{create-interpret/compile}.

@comment TODO

The text interpreter works on input one line at a time. Starting at
the beginning of the line, it skips leading spaces (called
@var{delimiters}) then parses a string (a sequence of non-space
characters) until it either reaches a space character or it
reaches the end of the line. Having parsed a string, it then makes two
attempts to do something with it:

* It looks the string up in a dictionary of definitions. If the string
  is found in the dictionary, the string names a @var{definition} (also
  known as a @var{word}) and the dictionary search will return an
  @var{Execution token} (xt) for the definition and some flags that show
  when the definition can be used legally. If the definition can be
  legally executed in @var{Interpret} mode then the text interpreter will
  use the xt to execute it, otherwise it will issue an error
  message. The dictionary is described in more detail in <blah>.

* If the string is not found in the dictionary, the text interpreter
  attempts to treat it as a number in the current radix (base 10 after
  initial startup). If the string represents a legal number in the
  current radix, the number is pushed onto the appropriate parameter
  stack. Stacks are discussed in more detail in <blah>. Number
  conversion is described in more detail in <section about +, -
  numbers and different number formats>.

If both of these attempts fail, the remainer of the input line is
discarded and the text interpreter isses an error message. If one of
these attempts succeeds, the text interpreter repeats the parsing
process until the end of the line has been reached. At this point, 
it prints the status message ``  ok'' and waits for more input.

There are two important things to note about the behaviour of the text
interpreter:

* it processes each input string to completion before parsing
  additional characters from the input line.

* it keeps track of its position in the input line using a variable
  (called >IN, pronounced ``to-in''). The value of >IN can be modified
  by the execution of definitions in the input line. This means that
  definitions can ``trick'' the text interpreter either into skipping
  sections of the input line or into parsing a section of the
  input line more than once.

If the text interpreter fails to find a particular string in the name

Let <digit> represent any character that is a legal digit in the current

Let <decimal digit> represent any character in the range 0-9.

Let @{+ | -@} represent the optional presence of either a @code{+} or
@code{-} character.

Let * represent any number of instances of the previous character
(including none).

Let any other character represent itself.

Now, the conversion rules are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A string of the form <digit><digit>* is treated as a single-precision
(CELL-sized) positive integer. Examples are 0 123 6784532 32343212343456 42
@item
A string of the form -<digit><digit>* is treated as a single-precision
(CELL-sized) negative integer, and is represented using 2's-complement
arithmetic. Examples are -45 -5681 -0
@item
A string of the form <digit><digit>*.<digit>* is treated as a double-precision
(double-CELL-sized) positive integer. Examples are 3465. 3.465 34.65
(and note that these all represent the same number).
@item
A string of the form -<digit><digit>*.<digit>* is treated as a
double-precision (double-CELL-sized) negative integer, and is
represented using 2's-complement arithmetic. Examples are -3465. -3.465
-34.65 (and note that these all represent the same number).
@item
A string of the form @{+ | -@}<decimal digit>@{.@}<decimal digit>*@{e | E@}@{+
| -@}<decimal digit><decimal digit>* is treated as floating-point
number. Examples are 1e0 1.e 1.e0 +1e+0 (which all represent the same
number) +12.E-4 
@end itemize

By default, the number base used for integer number conversion is given
by the contents of a variable named @code{BASE}. Base 10 (decimal) is
always used for floating-point number conversion.

doc-base
doc-hex
doc-decimal

@cindex '-prefix for character strings
@cindex &-prefix for decimal numbers
@cindex %-prefix for binary numbers
@cindex $-prefix for hexadecimal numbers
Gforth allows you to override the value of @code{BASE} by using a prefix
before the first digit of an (integer) number. Four prefixes are
supported:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{&} -- decimal number
@item
@code{%} -- binary number
@item
@code{$} -- hexadecimal number
@item
@code{'} -- base 256 number
@end itemize

Here are some examples, with the equivalent decimal number shown after
in braces:

-$41 (-65), %1001101 (205), %1001.0001 (145 - a double-precision number),
'AB (16706; ascii A is 65, ascii B is 66, number is 65*256 + 66),
'ab (24930; ascii a is 97, ascii B is 98, number is 97*256 + 98),
&905 (905), $abc (2478), $ABC (2478).

@cindex number conversion - traps for the unwary
Number conversion has a number of traps for the unwary:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You cannot determine the current number base using the code sequence
@code{BASE @@ .} -- the number base is always 10 in the current number
base. Instead, use something like @code{BASE @@ DECIMAL DUP . BASE !}
@item
If the number base is set to a value greater than 14 (for example,
hexadecimal), the number 123E4 is ambiguous; the conversion rules allow
it to be intepreted as either a single-precision integer or a
floating-point number (Gforth treats it as an integer). The ambiguity
can be resolved by explicitly stating the sign of the mantissa and/or
exponent: 123E+4 or +123E4 -- if the number base is decimal, no
ambiguity arises; either representation will be treated as a
floating-point number.
@item
There is a word @code{bin} but it does @var{not} set the number base!
It is used to specify file types.
@item
ANS Forth requires the @code{.} of a double-precision number to
be the final character in the string. Allowing the @code{.} to be
anywhere after the first digit is a Gforth extension.
@item
The number conversion process does not check for overflow.
@item
In Gforth, number conversion to floating-point numbers always use base
10, irrespective of the value of @code{BASE}. In ANS Forth,
conversion to floating-point numbers whilst the value of
@code{BASE} is not 10 is an ambiguous condition.

@section Tokens for Words
@cindex tokens for words

This chapter describes the creation and use of tokens that represent
words on the stack (and in data space).

Named words have interpretation and compilation semantics. Unnamed words
just have execution semantics.

@comment TODO ?normally interpretation semantics are the execution semantics.
@comment this should all be covered in earlier ss

@cindex execution token
An @dfn{execution token} represents the execution semantics of an
unnamed word. An execution token occupies one cell. As explained in
@ref{Supplying names}, the execution token of the last word
defined can be produced with @code{lastxt}.

doc-execute
doc-compile,

@cindex code field address
@cindex CFA
In Gforth, the abstract data type @emph{execution token} is implemented
as a code field address (CFA).
@comment TODO note that the standard does not say what it represents..
@comment and you cannot necessarily compile it in all Forths (eg native
@comment compilers?).

The interpretation semantics of a named word are also represented by an
execution token. You can get it with:

doc-[']
doc-'

For literals, you use @code{'} in interpreted code and @code{[']} in
compiled code. Gforth's @code{'} and @code{[']} behave somewhat unusually
by complaining about compile-only words. To get an execution token for a
compiling word @var{X}, use @code{COMP' @var{X} drop} or @code{[COMP']
@var{X} drop}.

@cindex compilation token
The compilation semantics are represented by a @dfn{compilation token}
consisting of two cells: @var{w xt}. The top cell @var{xt} is an
execution token. The compilation semantics represented by the
compilation token can be performed with @code{execute}, which consumes
the whole compilation token, with an additional stack effect determined
by the represented compilation semantics.

doc-[comp']
doc-comp'

You can compile the compilation semantics with @code{postpone,}. I.e.,
@code{COMP' @var{word} POSTPONE,} is equivalent to @code{POSTPONE
@var{word}}.

doc-postpone,

At present, the @var{w} part of a compilation token is an execution
token, and the @var{xt} part represents either @code{execute} or
@code{compile,}. However, don't rely on that knowledge, unless necessary;
we may introduce unusual compilation tokens in the future (e.g.,
compilation tokens representing the compilation semantics of literals).

@cindex name token
@cindex name field address
@cindex NFA
Named words are also represented by the @dfn{name token}, (@var{nt}). The abstract
data type @emph{name token} is implemented as a name field address (NFA).

@c -------------------------------------------------------------
@node Word Lists, Environmental Queries, Tokens for Words, Words
@section Word Lists
@cindex word lists
@cindex name dictionary

@cindex wid
All definitions other than those created by @code{:noname} have an entry
in the name dictionary. The name dictionary is fragmented into a number
of parts, called @var{word lists}. A word list is identified by a
cell-sized word list identifier (@var{wid}) in much the same way as a
file is identified by a file handle. The numerical value of the wid has
no (portable) meaning, and might change from session to session.

@cindex compilation word list
At any one time, a single word list is defined as the word list to which
all new definitions will be added -- this is called the @var{compilation
word list}. When Gforth is started, the compilation word list is the
word list called @code{FORTH-WORDLIST}.

@cindex search order stack
Forth maintains a stack of word lists, representing the @var{search
order}.  When the name dictionary is searched (for example, when
attempting to find a word's execution token during compilation), only
those word lists that are currently in the search order are
searched. The most recently-defined word in the word list at the top of
the word list stack is searched first, and the search proceeds until
either the word is located or the oldest definition in the word list at
the bottom of the stack is reached. Definitions of the word may exist in
more than one word lists; the search order determines which version will
be found.

The ANS Forth Standard ``Search order'' word set is intended to provide a
set of low-level tools that allow various different schemes to be
implemented. Gforth provides @code{vocabulary}, a traditional Forth

@subsection Why use word lists?
@cindex word lists - why use them?

There are several reasons for using multiple word lists:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To improve compilation speed by reducing the number of name dictionary
entries that must be searched. This is achieved by creating a new
word list that contains all of the definitions that are used in the
definition of a Forth system but which would not usually be used by
programs running on that system. That word list would be on the search
list when the Forth system was compiled but would be removed from the
search list for normal operation. This can be a useful technique for
low-performance systems (for example, 8-bit processors in embedded
systems) but is unlikely to be necessary in high-performance desktop
systems.
@item
To prevent a set of words from being used outside the context in which
they are valid. Two classic examples of this are an integrated editor
(all of the edit commands are defined in a separate word list; the
search order is set to the editor word list when the editor is invoked;
the old search order is restored when the editor is terminated) and an
integrated assembler (the op-codes for the machine are defined in a
separate word list which is used when a @code{CODE} word is defined).
@item
To prevent a name-space clash between multiple definitions with the same
name. For example, when building a cross-compiler you might have a word
@code{IF} that generates conditional code for your target system. By
placing this definition in a different word list you can control whether
the host system's @code{IF} or the target system's @code{IF} get used in
any particular context by controlling the order of the word lists on the
search order stack.
@end itemize

@node Word list examples, ,Why use word lists?, Word Lists
@subsection Word list examples
@cindex word lists - examples

Here is an example of creating and using a new wordlist using ANS
Forth Standard words:

@example
wordlist constant my-new-words-wordlist
: my-new-words get-order nip my-new-words-wordlist swap set-order ;

\ add it to the search order
also my-new-words

\ alternatively, add it to the search order and make it
\ the compilation word list
also my-new-words definitions
\ type "order" to see the problem
@end example

The problem with this example is that @code{order} has no way to
associate the name @code{my-new-words} with the wid of the word list (in
Gforth, @code{order} and @code{vocs} will display @code{???}  for a wid
that has no associated name). There is no Standard way of associating a
name with a wid.

In Gforth, this example can be re-coded using @code{vocabulary}, which
associates a name with a wid:

@example
vocabulary my-new-words

\ add it to the search order
my-new-words

\ alternatively, add it to the search order and make it
\ the compilation word list
my-new-words definitions
\ type "order" to see that the problem is solved
@end example

@node Environmental Queries, Files, Word Lists, Words
@section Environmental Queries
@cindex environmental queries
@comment TODO more index entries

ANS Forth introduced the idea of ``environmental queries'' as a way
for a program running on a system to determine certain characteristics of the system.
The Standard specifies a number of strings that might be recognised by a system.

The Standard requires that the name space used for environmental queries
be distinct from the name space used for definitions.

Typically, environmental queries are supported by creating a set of
definitions in a word list that is @var{only} used during environmental
queries; that is what Gforth does. There is no Standard way of adding
definitions to the set of recognised environmental queries, but any
implementation that supports the loading of optional word sets must have
some mechanism for doing this (after loading the word set, the
associated environmental query string must return @code{true}). In
Gforth, the word list used to honour environmental queries can be
manipulated just like any other word list.

doc-environment?
doc-environment-wordlist

doc-gforth
doc-os-class

Note that, whilst the documentation for (e.g.) @code{gforth} shows it
returning two items on the stack, querying it using @code{environment?}
will return an additional item; the @code{true} flag that shows that the
string was recognised.

@comment TODO Document the standard strings or note where they are documented herein

Here are some examples of using environmental queries:

@example
s" address-unit-bits" environment? 0=
[IF]
     cr .( environmental attribute address-units-bits unknown... ) cr
[THEN]

s" block" environment? [IF] DROP include block.fs [THEN]

s" gforth" environment? [IF] 2DROP include compat/vocabulary.fs [THEN]

s" gforth" environment? [IF] .( Gforth version ) TYPE
                        [ELSE] .( Not Gforth..) [THEN]
@end example


Here is an example of adding a definition to the environment word list:

@example
get-current environment-wordlist set-current
true constant block
true constant block-ext
set-current
@end example

You can see what definitions are in the environment word list like this:

@example
get-order 1+ environment-wordlist swap set-order words previous

The simplest way to interpret the contents of a file is to use one of
these two formats:

Sometimes you want to include a file only if it is not included already
(by, say, another source file). In that case, you can use one of these

needs mysource.fs
s" mysource.fs" required

@node Search Paths, Forth Search Paths, General files, Files
@subsection Search Paths
@cindex path for @code{included}
@cindex file search path
@cindex @code{include} search path
@cindex search path for files

@comment what uses these search paths.. just include and friends?
If you specify an absolute filename (i.e., a filename starting with
@file{/} or @file{~}, or with @file{:} in the second position (as in
@samp{C:...})) for @code{included} and friends, that file is included
just as you would expect.

For relative filenames, Gforth uses a search path similar to Forth's
search order (@pxref{Word Lists}). It tries to find the given filename
in the directories present in the path, and includes the first one it
finds. There are separate search paths for Forth source files and
general files.

If the search path contains the directory @file{.} (as it should), this
refers to the directory that the present file was @code{included}
from. This allows files to include other files relative to their own
position (irrespective of the current working directory or the absolute
position).  This feature is essential for libraries consisting of
several files, where a file may include other files from the library.
It corresponds to @code{#include "..."} in C. If the current input
source is not a file, @file{.} refers to the directory of the innermost
file being included, or, if there is no file being included, to the
current working directory.

Use @file{~+} to refer to the current working directory (as in the
@code{bash}).

If the filename starts with @file{./}, the search path is not searched
(just as with absolute filenames), and the @file{.} has the same meaning
as described above.

The search path is initialized when you start Gforth (@pxref{Invoking

Your application may need to search files in several directories, like

and use your own search paths, by providing generic equivalents of the
Forth search path words:

doc-.path

Here's an example of creating a search path:

                0 ,             \ real len

Block files are traditionally means of data and source storage in

@node Formatted numeric output, String Formats, Simple numeric output, Other I/O
@subsection Formatted numeric output
@cindex Formatted numeric output
@cindex pictured numeric output
@comment TODO more index entries

Forth traditionally uses a technique called @var{pictured numeric
output} for formatted printing of integers.  In this technique, digits
are extracted from the number (using the current output radix defined by
@code{base}), converted to ASCII codes and appended to a string that is
built in a scratch-pad area of memory (@pxref{core-idef,
Implementation-defined options, Implementation-defined
options}). Arbitrary characters can be appended to the string during the
extraction process. The completed string is specified by an address
and length and can be manipulated (@code{TYPE}ed, copied, modified)
under program control.

All of the words described in the previous section for simple numeric
output are implemented in Gforth using pictured numeric output.

Three important things to remember about Pictured Numeric Output:

@itemize @bullet
@item
It always operates on double-precision numbers; to display a single-precision number,
convert it first (@pxref{Double precision} for ways of doing this).
@item
It always treats the double-precision number as though it were unsigned. Refer to
the examples below for ways of printing signed numbers.
@item
The string is built up from right to left; least significant digit first.
@end itemize

doc-<#
doc-#
doc-#s
doc-hold
doc-sign
doc-#>

Here are some examples of using pictured numeric output:

@example

@node String Formats, Displaying characters and strings, Formatted numeric output, Other I/O
@subsection String Formats
@cindex string formats

@comment TODO more index entries

Forth commonly uses two different methods for representing a string:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex address of counted string
As a @var{counted string}, represented by a @var{c-addr}. The char
addressed by @var{c-addr} contains a character-count, @var{n}, of the
string and the string occupies the subsequent @var{n} char addresses in
memory.
@item
As cell pair on the stack; @var{c-addr u}, where @var{u} is the length
of the string in characters, and @var{c-addr} is the address of the
first byte of the string.
@end itemize

ANS Forth encourages the use of the second format when representing
strings on the stack, whilst conceeding that the counted string format
remains useful as a way of storing strings in memory.

When you load this code into Gforth, the following output is generated:

@example

@end example

@itemize @bullet
@item
Messages @code{text-1} and @code{text-3} are displayed because @code{.(} 
is an immediate word; it behaves in the same way whether it is used inside
or outside a colon definition.
@item
Message @code{text-4} is displayed because of Gforth's added interpretation
semantics for @code{."}.
@item
Message @code{text-2} is @var{not} displayed, because the text interpreter
performs the compilation semantics for @code{."} within the definition of
@code{my-word}.

@example
@kbd{my-word <return>} text-2

@end example

@itemize @bullet
@item
Message @code{text-2} is displayed because of the run-time behaviour of
@code{."}.
@item
@code{[char]} compiles the ``A'' from ``ALPHABET'' and puts its display code
on the stack at run-time. @code{emit} always displays the character
when @code{my-char} is executed.
@item
@code{char} parses a string at run-time and the second @code{emit} displays
the first character of the string.
@item
If you type @code{see my-char} you can see that @code{[char]} discarded
the text ``LPHABET'' and only compiled the display code for ``A'' into the

@subsection Debugging
@cindex debugging

Languages with a slow edit/compile/link/test development loop tend to
require sophisticated tracing/stepping debuggers to facilate
productive debugging.

A much better (faster) way in fast-compiling languages is to add
printing code at well-selected places, let the program run, look at
the output, see where things went wrong, add more printing code, etc.,
until the bug is found.

The simple debugging aids provided in @file{debugs.fs}
are meant to support this style of debugging. In addition, there are
words for non-destructively inspecting the stack and memory:

doc-.s
doc-f.s

There is a word @code{.r} but it does @var{not} display the return
stack! It is used for formatted numeric output.

doc-depth
doc-fdepth
doc-clearstack
doc-?
doc-dump

The word @code{~~} prints debugging information (by default the source
location and the stack contents). It is easy to insert. If you use Emacs
it is also easy to remove (@kbd{C-x ~} in the Emacs Forth mode to
query-replace them with nothing). The deferred words
@code{printdebugdata} and @code{printdebugline} control the output of
@code{~~}. The default source location output format works well with
Emacs' compilation mode, so you can step through the program at the
source level using @kbd{C-x `} (the advantage over a stepping debugger
is that you can step in any direction and you know where the crash has
happened or where the strange data has occurred).

The default actions of @code{~~} clobber the contents of the pictured
numeric output string, so you should not use @code{~~}, e.g., between
@code{<#} and @code{#>}.

doc-~~
doc-printdebugdata
doc-printdebugline

doc-see
doc-marker

Here's an example of using @code{marker} at the start of a source file
that you are debugging; it ensures that you only ever have one copy of
the file's definitions compiled at any time:

@example
[IFDEF] my-code
    my-code
[ENDIF]

marker my-code

\ .. definitions start here
\ .
\ .
\ end
@end example



@node Assertions, Singlestep Debugger, Debugging, Programming Tools
@subsection Assertions
@cindex assertions

It is a good idea to make your programs self-checking, especially if you
make an assumption that may become invalid during maintenance (for
example, that a certain field of a data structure is never zero). Gforth
supports @var{assertions} for this purpose. They are used like this:

@example
assert( @var{flag} )
@end example

The code between @code{assert(} and @code{)} should compute a flag, that
should be true if everything is alright and false otherwise. It should
not change anything else on the stack. The overall stack effect of the
assertion is @code{( -- )}. E.g.

@example
assert( 1 1 + 2 = ) \ what we learn in school
assert( dup 0<> ) \ assert that the top of stack is not zero
assert( false ) \ this code should not be reached
@end example

The need for assertions is different at different times. During
debugging, we want more checking, in production we sometimes care more
for speed. Therefore, assertions can be turned off, i.e., the assertion
becomes a comment. Depending on the importance of an assertion and the
time it takes to check it, you may want to turn off some assertions and
keep others turned on. Gforth provides several levels of assertions for
this purpose:

doc-assert0(
doc-assert1(
doc-assert2(
doc-assert3(
doc-assert(
doc-)

The variable @code{assert-level} specifies the highest assertions that
are turned on. I.e., at the default @code{assert-level} of one,
@code{assert0(} and @code{assert1(} assertions perform checking, while
@code{assert2(} and @code{assert3(} assertions are treated as comments.

The value of @code{assert-level} is evaluated at compile-time, not at
run-time. Therefore you cannot turn assertions on or off at run-time;
you have to set the @code{assert-level} appropriately before compiling a
piece of code. You can compile different pieces of code at different
@code{assert-level}s (e.g., a trusted library at level 1 and
newly-written code at level 3).

doc-assert-level

If an assertion fails, a message compatible with Emacs' compilation mode
is produced and the execution is aborted (currently with @code{ABORT"}.
If there is interest, we will introduce a special throw code. But if you
intend to @code{catch} a specific condition, using @code{throw} is
probably more appropriate than an assertion).

Definitions in ANS Forth for these assertion words are provided
in @file{compat/assert.fs}.

Each line displayed is one step. You always have to hit return to
execute the next word that is displayed. If you don't want to execute
the next word in a whole, you have to type @kbd{n} for @code{nest}. Here is
an overview what keys are available:

@table @i

@item <return>
Next; Execute the next word.

@item n
Nest; Single step through next word.

@item u
Unnest; Stop debugging and execute rest of word. If we got to this word
with nest, continue debugging with the calling word.

@item d
Done; Stop debugging and execute rest.

@item s
Stop; Abort immediately.

@end table

Debugging large application with this mechanism is very difficult, because
you have to nest very deeply into the program before the interesting part
begins. This takes a lot of time. 

To do it more directly put a @code{BREAK:} command into your source code.
When program execution reaches @code{BREAK:} the single step debugger is
invoked and you have all the features described above.

If you have more than one part to debug it is useful to know where the
program has stopped at the moment. You can do this by the 
@code{BREAK" string"} command. This behaves like @code{BREAK:} except that
string is typed out when the ``breakpoint'' is reached.

@section Assembler and Code Words
@cindex assembler
@cindex code words

Gforth provides some words for defining primitives (words written in
machine code), and for defining the the machine-code equivalent of
@code{DOES>}-based defining words. However, the machine-independent
nature of Gforth poses a few problems: First of all, Gforth runs on
several architectures, so it can provide no standard assembler. What's
worse is that the register allocation not only depends on the processor,
but also on the @code{gcc} version and options used.

The words that Gforth offers encapsulate some system dependences (e.g., the
header structure), so a system-independent assembler may be used in
Gforth. If you do not have an assembler, you can compile machine code
directly with @code{,} and @code{c,}.

doc-assembler
doc-code
doc-end-code
doc-;code
doc-flush-icache

If @code{flush-icache} does not work correctly, @code{code} words
etc. will not work (reliably), either.

@code{flush-icache} is always present. The other words are rarely used
and reside in @code{code.fs}, which is usually not loaded. You can load
it with @code{require code.fs}.

@cindex registers of the inner interpreter
In the assembly code you will want to refer to the inner interpreter's
registers (e.g., the data stack pointer) and you may want to use other
registers for temporary storage. Unfortunately, the register allocation
is installation-dependent.

The easiest solution is to use explicit register declarations
(@pxref{Explicit Reg Vars, , Variables in Specified Registers, gcc.info,
GNU C Manual}) for all of the inner interpreter's registers: You have to
compile Gforth with @code{-DFORCE_REG} (configure option
@code{--enable-force-reg}) and the appropriate declarations must be
present in the @code{machine.h} file (see @code{mips.h} for an example;
you can find a full list of all declarable register symbols with
@code{grep register engine.c}). If you give explicit registers to all
variables that are declared at the beginning of @code{engine()}, you
should be able to use the other caller-saved registers for temporary
storage. Alternatively, you can use the @code{gcc} option
@code{-ffixed-REG} (@pxref{Code Gen Options, , Options for Code
Generation Conventions, gcc.info, GNU C Manual}) to reserve a register
(however, this restriction on register allocation may slow Gforth
significantly).

If this solution is not viable (e.g., because @code{gcc} does not allow
you to explicitly declare all the registers you need), you have to find
out by looking at the code where the inner interpreter's registers
reside and which registers can be used for temporary storage. You can
get an assembly listing of the engine's code with @code{make engine.s}.

In any case, it is good practice to abstract your assembly code from the
actual register allocation. E.g., if the data stack pointer resides in
register @code{$17}, create an alias for this register called @code{sp},
and use that in your assembly code.

@cindex code words, portable
Another option for implementing normal and defining words efficiently
is to add the desired functionality to the source of Gforth. For normal
words you just have to edit @file{primitives} (@pxref{Automatic
Generation}). Defining words (equivalent to @code{;CODE} words, for fast
defined words) may require changes in @file{engine.c}, @file{kernel.fs},
@file{prims2x.fs}, and possibly @file{cross.fs}.

@section Threading Words
@cindex threading words

@cindex code address
These words provide access to code addresses and other threading stuff
in Gforth (and, possibly, other interpretive Forths). It more or less
abstracts away the differences between direct and indirect threading
(and, for direct threading, the machine dependences). However, at
present this wordset is still incomplete. It is also pretty low-level;
some day it will hopefully be made unnecessary by an internals wordset
that abstracts implementation details away completely.

doc-threading-method
doc->code-address

doc-code-address!

The code addresses produced by various defining words are produced by
the following words:

doc-docol:
doc-docon:
doc-dovar:
doc-douser:
doc-dodefer:
doc-dofield:

You can recognize words defined by a @code{CREATE}...@code{DOES>} word
with @code{>does-code}. If the word was defined in that way, the value
returned is non-zero and identifies the @code{DOES>} used by the
defining word.

@cindex locals

Local variables can make Forth programming more enjoyable and Forth
programs easier to read. Unfortunately, the locals of ANS Forth are
laden with restrictions. Therefore, we provide not only the ANS Forth
locals wordset, but also our own, more powerful locals wordset (we
implemented the ANS Forth locals wordset through our locals wordset).

The ideas in this section have also been published in the paper
@cite{Automatic Scoping of Local Variables} by M. Anton Ertl, presented
at EuroForth '94; it is available at
@*@url{http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/papers/ertl94l.ps.gz}.

@cindex locals, Gforth style

Locals can be defined with

@example
@{ local1 local2 ... -- comment @}
@end example
or
@example
@{ local1 local2 ... @}
@end example

E.g.,
@example
: max @{ n1 n2 -- n3 @}
 n1 n2 > if
   n1
 else
   n2
 endif ;
@end example

The similarity of locals definitions with stack comments is intended. A
locals definition often replaces the stack comment of a word. The order
of the locals corresponds to the order in a stack comment and everything
after the @code{--} is really a comment.

This similarity has one disadvantage: It is too easy to confuse locals
declarations with stack comments, causing bugs and making them hard to
find. However, this problem can be avoided by appropriate coding
conventions: Do not use both notations in the same program. If you do,
they should be distinguished using additional means, e.g. by position.

@cindex types of locals
@cindex locals types
The name of the local may be preceded by a type specifier, e.g.,
@code{F:} for a floating point value:

@example
: CX* @{ F: Ar F: Ai F: Br F: Bi -- Cr Ci @}
\ complex multiplication
 Ar Br f* Ai Bi f* f-
 Ar Bi f* Ai Br f* f+ ;
@end example

@cindex flavours of locals

Gforth currently supports cells (@code{W:}, @code{W^}), doubles
(@code{D:}, @code{D^}), floats (@code{F:}, @code{F^}) and characters
(@code{C:}, @code{C^}) in two flavours: a value-flavoured local (defined
with @code{W:}, @code{D:} etc.) produces its value and can be changed
with @code{TO}. A variable-flavoured local (defined with @code{W^} etc.)
produces its address (which becomes invalid when the variable's scope is
left). E.g., the standard word @code{emit} can be defined in terms of
@code{type} like this:

@example
: emit @{ C^ char* -- @}
    char* 1 type ;
@end example

@cindex default type of locals
@cindex locals, default type
A local without type specifier is a @code{W:} local. Both flavours of
locals are initialized with values from the data or FP stack.

Currently there is no way to define locals with user-defined data
structures, but we are working on it.

Gforth allows defining locals everywhere in a colon definition. This
poses the following questions:

@menu

@end menu

@node Where are locals visible by name?, How long do locals live?, Gforth locals, Gforth locals
@subsubsection Where are locals visible by name?
@cindex locals visibility
@cindex visibility of locals
@cindex scope of locals

Basically, the answer is that locals are visible where you would expect
it in block-structured languages, and sometimes a little longer. If you
want to restrict the scope of a local, enclose its definition in
@code{SCOPE}...@code{ENDSCOPE}.

doc-scope
doc-endscope

These words behave like control structure words, so you can use them
with @code{CS-PICK} and @code{CS-ROLL} to restrict the scope in
arbitrary ways.

If you want a more exact answer to the visibility question, here's the
basic principle: A local is visible in all places that can only be
reached through the definition of the local@footnote{In compiler
construction terminology, all places dominated by the definition of the
local.}. In other words, it is not visible in places that can be reached
without going through the definition of the local. E.g., locals defined
in @code{IF}...@code{ENDIF} are visible until the @code{ENDIF}, locals
defined in @code{BEGIN}...@code{UNTIL} are visible after the
@code{UNTIL} (until, e.g., a subsequent @code{ENDSCOPE}).

The reasoning behind this solution is: We want to have the locals
visible as long as it is meaningful. The user can always make the
visibility shorter by using explicit scoping. In a place that can
only be reached through the definition of a local, the meaning of a
local name is clear. In other places it is not: How is the local
initialized at the control flow path that does not contain the
definition? Which local is meant, if the same name is defined twice in
two independent control flow paths?

This should be enough detail for nearly all users, so you can skip the
rest of this section. If you really must know all the gory details and
options, read on.

In order to implement this rule, the compiler has to know which places
are unreachable. It knows this automatically after @code{AHEAD},
@code{AGAIN}, @code{EXIT} and @code{LEAVE}; in other cases (e.g., after
most @code{THROW}s), you can use the word @code{UNREACHABLE} to tell the
compiler that the control flow never reaches that place. If
@code{UNREACHABLE} is not used where it could, the only consequence is
that the visibility of some locals is more limited than the rule above
says. If @code{UNREACHABLE} is used where it should not (i.e., if you
lie to the compiler), buggy code will be produced.

doc-unreachable

Another problem with this rule is that at @code{BEGIN}, the compiler
does not know which locals will be visible on the incoming
back-edge. All problems discussed in the following are due to this
ignorance of the compiler (we discuss the problems using @code{BEGIN}
loops as examples; the discussion also applies to @code{?DO} and other
loops). Perhaps the most insidious example is:
@example
AHEAD
BEGIN
  x
[ 1 CS-ROLL ] THEN
  @{ x @}
  ...
UNTIL
@end example

This should be legal according to the visibility rule. The use of
@code{x} can only be reached through the definition; but that appears
textually below the use.

From this example it is clear that the visibility rules cannot be fully
implemented without major headaches. Our implementation treats common
cases as advertised and the exceptions are treated in a safe way: The
compiler makes a reasonable guess about the locals visible after a
@code{BEGIN}; if it is too pessimistic, the
user will get a spurious error about the local not being defined; if the
compiler is too optimistic, it will notice this later and issue a
warning. In the case above the compiler would complain about @code{x}
being undefined at its use. You can see from the obscure examples in
this section that it takes quite unusual control structures to get the
compiler into trouble, and even then it will often do fine.

If the @code{BEGIN} is reachable from above, the most optimistic guess
is that all locals visible before the @code{BEGIN} will also be
visible after the @code{BEGIN}. This guess is valid for all loops that
are entered only through the @code{BEGIN}, in particular, for normal
@code{BEGIN}...@code{WHILE}...@code{REPEAT} and
@code{BEGIN}...@code{UNTIL} loops and it is implemented in our
compiler. When the branch to the @code{BEGIN} is finally generated by
@code{AGAIN} or @code{UNTIL}, the compiler checks the guess and
warns the user if it was too optimistic:
@example
IF
  @{ x @}
BEGIN
  \ x ? 
[ 1 cs-roll ] THEN
  ...
UNTIL
@end example

Here, @code{x} lives only until the @code{BEGIN}, but the compiler
optimistically assumes that it lives until the @code{THEN}. It notices
this difference when it compiles the @code{UNTIL} and issues a
warning. The user can avoid the warning, and make sure that @code{x}
is not used in the wrong area by using explicit scoping:
@example
IF
  SCOPE
  @{ x @}
  ENDSCOPE
BEGIN
[ 1 cs-roll ] THEN
  ...
UNTIL
@end example

Since the guess is optimistic, there will be no spurious error messages
about undefined locals.

If the @code{BEGIN} is not reachable from above (e.g., after
@code{AHEAD} or @code{EXIT}), the compiler cannot even make an
optimistic guess, as the locals visible after the @code{BEGIN} may be
defined later. Therefore, the compiler assumes that no locals are
visible after the @code{BEGIN}. However, the user can use
@code{ASSUME-LIVE} to make the compiler assume that the same locals are
visible at the BEGIN as at the point where the top control-flow stack
item was created.

doc-assume-live

E.g.,
@example
@{ x @}
AHEAD
ASSUME-LIVE
BEGIN
  x
[ 1 CS-ROLL ] THEN
  ...
UNTIL
@end example

Other cases where the locals are defined before the @code{BEGIN} can be
handled by inserting an appropriate @code{CS-ROLL} before the
@code{ASSUME-LIVE} (and changing the control-flow stack manipulation
behind the @code{ASSUME-LIVE}).

Cases where locals are defined after the @code{BEGIN} (but should be
visible immediately after the @code{BEGIN}) can only be handled by
rearranging the loop. E.g., the ``most insidious'' example above can be
arranged into:
@example
BEGIN
  @{ x @}
  ... 0=
WHILE
  x
REPEAT
@end example

@node How long do locals live?, Programming Style, Where are locals visible by name?, Gforth locals
@subsubsection How long do locals live?
@cindex locals lifetime
@cindex lifetime of locals

The right answer for the lifetime question would be: A local lives at
least as long as it can be accessed. For a value-flavoured local this
means: until the end of its visibility. However, a variable-flavoured
local could be accessed through its address far beyond its visibility
scope. Ultimately, this would mean that such locals would have to be
garbage collected. Since this entails un-Forth-like implementation
complexities, I adopted the same cowardly solution as some other
languages (e.g., C): The local lives only as long as it is visible;
afterwards its address is invalid (and programs that access it
afterwards are erroneous).

@node Programming Style, Implementation, How long do locals live?, Gforth locals
@subsubsection Programming Style
@cindex locals programming style
@cindex programming style, locals

The freedom to define locals anywhere has the potential to change
programming styles dramatically. In particular, the need to use the
return stack for intermediate storage vanishes. Moreover, all stack
manipulations (except @code{PICK}s and @code{ROLL}s with run-time
determined arguments) can be eliminated: If the stack items are in the
wrong order, just write a locals definition for all of them; then
write the items in the order you want.

This seems a little far-fetched and eliminating stack manipulations is
unlikely to become a conscious programming objective. Still, the number
of stack manipulations will be reduced dramatically if local variables
are used liberally (e.g., compare @code{max} in @ref{Gforth locals} with
a traditional implementation of @code{max}).

This shows one potential benefit of locals: making Forth programs more
readable. Of course, this benefit will only be realized if the
programmers continue to honour the principle of factoring instead of
using the added latitude to make the words longer.

@cindex single-assignment style for locals
Using @code{TO} can and should be avoided.  Without @code{TO},
every value-flavoured local has only a single assignment and many
advantages of functional languages apply to Forth. I.e., programs are
easier to analyse, to optimize and to read: It is clear from the
definition what the local stands for, it does not turn into something
different later.

E.g., a definition using @code{TO} might look like this:
@example
: strcmp @{ addr1 u1 addr2 u2 -- n @}
 u1 u2 min 0
 ?do
   addr1 c@@ addr2 c@@ -
   ?dup-if
     unloop exit
   then
   addr1 char+ TO addr1
   addr2 char+ TO addr2
 loop
 u1 u2 - ;
@end example
Here, @code{TO} is used to update @code{addr1} and @code{addr2} at
every loop iteration. @code{strcmp} is a typical example of the
readability problems of using @code{TO}. When you start reading
@code{strcmp}, you think that @code{addr1} refers to the start of the
string. Only near the end of the loop you realize that it is something
else.

This can be avoided by defining two locals at the start of the loop that
are initialized with the right value for the current iteration.
@example
: strcmp @{ addr1 u1 addr2 u2 -- n @}
 addr1 addr2
 u1 u2 min 0 
 ?do @{ s1 s2 @}
   s1 c@@ s2 c@@ -
   ?dup-if
     unloop exit
   then
   s1 char+ s2 char+
 loop
 2drop
 u1 u2 - ;
@end example
Here it is clear from the start that @code{s1} has a different value
in every loop iteration.

@node Implementation,  , Programming Style, Gforth locals
@subsubsection Implementation
@cindex locals implementation
@cindex implementation of locals

@cindex locals stack
Gforth uses an extra locals stack. The most compelling reason for
this is that the return stack is not float-aligned; using an extra stack
also eliminates the problems and restrictions of using the return stack
as locals stack. Like the other stacks, the locals stack grows toward
lower addresses. A few primitives allow an efficient implementation:

doc-@local#
doc-f@local#
doc-laddr#
doc-lp+!#
doc-lp!
doc->l
doc-f>l

In addition to these primitives, some specializations of these
primitives for commonly occurring inline arguments are provided for
efficiency reasons, e.g., @code{@@local0} as specialization of
@code{@@local#} for the inline argument 0. The following compiling words
compile the right specialized version, or the general version, as
appropriate:

doc-compile-@local
doc-compile-f@local
doc-compile-lp+!

Combinations of conditional branches and @code{lp+!#} like
@code{?branch-lp+!#} (the locals pointer is only changed if the branch
is taken) are provided for efficiency and correctness in loops.

A special area in the dictionary space is reserved for keeping the
local variable names. @code{@{} switches the dictionary pointer to this
area and @code{@}} switches it back and generates the locals
initializing code. @code{W:} etc.@ are normal defining words. This
special area is cleared at the start of every colon definition.

@cindex word list for defining locals
A special feature of Gforth's dictionary is used to implement the
definition of locals without type specifiers: every word list (aka
vocabulary) has its own methods for searching
etc. (@pxref{Word Lists}). For the present purpose we defined a word list
with a special search method: When it is searched for a word, it
actually creates that word using @code{W:}. @code{@{} changes the search
order to first search the word list containing @code{@}}, @code{W:} etc.,
and then the word list for defining locals without type specifiers.

The lifetime rules support a stack discipline within a colon
definition: The lifetime of a local is either nested with other locals
lifetimes or it does not overlap them.

At @code{BEGIN}, @code{IF}, and @code{AHEAD} no code for locals stack
pointer manipulation is generated. Between control structure words
locals definitions can push locals onto the locals stack. @code{AGAIN}
is the simplest of the other three control flow words. It has to
restore the locals stack depth of the corresponding @code{BEGIN}
before branching. The code looks like this:
@format
@code{lp+!#} current-locals-size @minus{} dest-locals-size
@code{branch} <begin>
@end format

@code{UNTIL} is a little more complicated: If it branches back, it
must adjust the stack just like @code{AGAIN}. But if it falls through,
the locals stack must not be changed. The compiler generates the
following code:
@format
@code{?branch-lp+!#} <begin> current-locals-size @minus{} dest-locals-size
@end format
The locals stack pointer is only adjusted if the branch is taken.

@code{THEN} can produce somewhat inefficient code:
@format
@code{lp+!#} current-locals-size @minus{} orig-locals-size
<orig target>:
@code{lp+!#} orig-locals-size @minus{} new-locals-size
@end format
The second @code{lp+!#} adjusts the locals stack pointer from the
level at the @var{orig} point to the level after the @code{THEN}. The
first @code{lp+!#} adjusts the locals stack pointer from the current
level to the level at the orig point, so the complete effect is an
adjustment from the current level to the right level after the
@code{THEN}.

@cindex locals information on the control-flow stack
@cindex control-flow stack items, locals information
In a conventional Forth implementation a dest control-flow stack entry
is just the target address and an orig entry is just the address to be
patched. Our locals implementation adds a word list to every orig or dest
item. It is the list of locals visible (or assumed visible) at the point
described by the entry. Our implementation also adds a tag to identify
the kind of entry, in particular to differentiate between live and dead
(reachable and unreachable) orig entries.

A few unusual operations have to be performed on locals word lists:

doc-common-list
doc-sub-list?
doc-list-size

Several features of our locals word list implementation make these
operations easy to implement: The locals word lists are organised as
linked lists; the tails of these lists are shared, if the lists
contain some of the same locals; and the address of a name is greater
than the address of the names behind it in the list.

Another important implementation detail is the variable
@code{dead-code}. It is used by @code{BEGIN} and @code{THEN} to
determine if they can be reached directly or only through the branch
that they resolve. @code{dead-code} is set by @code{UNREACHABLE},
@code{AHEAD}, @code{EXIT} etc., and cleared at the start of a colon
definition, by @code{BEGIN} and usually by @code{THEN}.

Counted loops are similar to other loops in most respects, but
@code{LEAVE} requires special attention: It performs basically the same
service as @code{AHEAD}, but it does not create a control-flow stack
entry. Therefore the information has to be stored elsewhere;
traditionally, the information was stored in the target fields of the
branches created by the @code{LEAVE}s, by organizing these fields into a
linked list. Unfortunately, this clever trick does not provide enough
space for storing our extended control flow information. Therefore, we
introduce another stack, the leave stack. It contains the control-flow
stack entries for all unresolved @code{LEAVE}s.

Local names are kept until the end of the colon definition, even if
they are no longer visible in any control-flow path. In a few cases
this may lead to increased space needs for the locals name area, but
usually less than reclaiming this space would cost in code size.


@node ANS Forth locals,  , Gforth locals, Locals
@subsection ANS Forth locals
@cindex locals, ANS Forth style

The ANS Forth locals wordset does not define a syntax for locals, but
words that make it possible to define various syntaxes. One of the
possible syntaxes is a subset of the syntax we used in the Gforth locals
wordset, i.e.:

@example
@{ local1 local2 ... -- comment @}
@end example
@noindent
or
@example
@{ local1 local2 ... @}
@end example

The order of the locals corresponds to the order in a stack comment. The
restrictions are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Locals can only be cell-sized values (no type specifiers are allowed).
@item
Locals can be defined only outside control structures.
@item
Locals can interfere with explicit usage of the return stack. For the
exact (and long) rules, see the standard. If you don't use return stack
accessing words in a definition using locals, you will be all right. The
purpose of this rule is to make locals implementation on the return
stack easier.
@item
The whole definition must be in one line.
@end itemize

Locals defined in this way behave like @code{VALUE}s (@xref{Simple
Defining Words}). I.e., they are initialized from the stack. Using their
name produces their value. Their value can be changed using @code{TO}.

Since this syntax is supported by Gforth directly, you need not do
anything to use it. If you want to port a program using this syntax to
another ANS Forth system, use @file{compat/anslocal.fs} to implement the
syntax on the other system.

Note that a syntax shown in the standard, section A.13 looks
similar, but is quite different in having the order of locals
reversed. Beware!

The ANS Forth locals wordset itself consists of a word:

doc-(local)

The ANS Forth locals extension wordset defines a syntax using @code{locals|}, but it is so
awful that we strongly recommend not to use it. We have implemented this
syntax to make porting to Gforth easy, but do not document it here. The
problem with this syntax is that the locals are defined in an order
reversed with respect to the standard stack comment notation, making
programs harder to read, and easier to misread and miswrite. The only
merit of this syntax is that it is easy to implement using the ANS Forth
locals wordset.

(@pxref{Address arithmetic}). As an example, consider a structure with
the following fields

@table @code
@item a
is a float
@item b
is a cell
@item c
is a float
@end table

Given the (float-aligned) base address of the structure we get the
address of the field

@table @code
@item a
without doing anything further.
@item b
with @code{float+}
@item c
with @code{float+ cell+ faligned}
@end table

It is easy to see that this can become quite tiring. 

Moreover, it is not very readable, because seeing a
@code{cell+} tells us neither which kind of structure is
accessed nor what field is accessed; we have to somehow infer the kind
of structure, and then look up in the documentation, which field of
that structure corresponds to that offset.

Finally, this kind of address arithmetic also causes maintenance
troubles: If you add or delete a field somewhere in the middle of the
structure, you have to find and change all computations for the fields
afterwards.

So, instead of using @code{cell+} and friends directly, how
about storing the offsets in constants:

@example
0 constant a-offset
0 float+ constant b-offset
0 float+ cell+ faligned c-offset
@end example

Now we can get the address of field @code{x} with @code{x-offset
+}. This is much better in all respects. Of course, you still
have to change all later offset definitions if you add a field. You can
fix this by declaring the offsets in the following way:

@example
0 constant a-offset
a-offset float+ constant b-offset
b-offset cell+ faligned constant c-offset
@end example

Since we always use the offsets with @code{+}, we could use a defining
word @code{cfield} that includes the @code{+} in the action of the
defined word:

@example
: cfield ( n "name" -- )
    create ,
does> ( name execution: addr1 -- addr2 )
    @@ + ;

0 cfield a
0 a float+ cfield b
0 b cell+ faligned cfield c
@end example

Instead of @code{x-offset +}, we now simply write @code{x}.

The structure field words now can be used quite nicely. However,
their definition is still a bit cumbersome: We have to repeat the
name, the information about size and alignment is distributed before
and after the field definitions etc.  The structure package presented
here addresses these problems.

@node Structure Usage, Structure Naming Convention, Why explicit structure support?, Structures
@subsection Structure Usage
@cindex structure usage

@cindex @code{field} usage
@cindex @code{struct} usage
@cindex @code{end-struct} usage
You can define a structure for a (data-less) linked list with:
@example
struct
    cell% field list-next
end-struct list%
@end example

With the address of the list node on the stack, you can compute the
address of the field that contains the address of the next node with
@code{list-next}. E.g., you can determine the length of a list
with:

@example
: list-length ( list -- n )
\ "list" is a pointer to the first element of a linked list
\ "n" is the length of the list
    0 BEGIN ( list1 n1 )
        over
    WHILE ( list1 n1 )
        1+ swap list-next @@ swap
    REPEAT
    nip ;
@end example

You can reserve memory for a list node in the dictionary with
@code{list% %allot}, which leaves the address of the list node on the
stack. For the equivalent allocation on the heap you can use @code{list%
%alloc} (or, for an @code{allocate}-like stack effect (i.e., with ior),
use @code{list% %allocate}). You can get the the size of a list
node with @code{list% %size} and its alignment with @code{list%
%alignment}.

Note that in ANS Forth the body of a @code{create}d word is
@code{aligned} but not necessarily @code{faligned};
therefore, if you do a:
@example
create @emph{name} foo% %allot
@end example

@noindent
then the memory alloted for @code{foo%} is
guaranteed to start at the body of @code{@emph{name}} only if
@code{foo%} contains only character, cell and double fields.

@cindex strcutures containing structures
You can include a structure @code{foo%} as a field of
another structure, like this:
@example
struct
...
    foo% field ...
...
end-struct ...
@end example

@cindex structure extension
@cindex extended records
Instead of starting with an empty structure, you can extend an
existing structure. E.g., a plain linked list without data, as defined
above, is hardly useful; You can extend it to a linked list of integers,
like this:@footnote{This feature is also known as @emph{extended
records}. It is the main innovation in the Oberon language; in other
words, adding this feature to Modula-2 led Wirth to create a new
language, write a new compiler etc.  Adding this feature to Forth just
required a few lines of code.}

@example
list%
    cell% field intlist-int
end-struct intlist%
@end example

@code{intlist%} is a structure with two fields:
@code{list-next} and @code{intlist-int}.

@cindex structures containing arrays
You can specify an array type containing @emph{n} elements of
type @code{foo%} like this:

@example
foo% @emph{n} *
@end example

You can use this array type in any place where you can use a normal
type, e.g., when defining a @code{field}, or with
@code{%allot}.

@cindex first field optimization
The first field is at the base address of a structure and the word
for this field (e.g., @code{list-next}) actually does not change
the address on the stack. You may be tempted to leave it away in the
interest of run-time and space efficiency. This is not necessary,
because the structure package optimizes this case and compiling such
words does not generate any code. So, in the interest of readability
and maintainability you should include the word for the field when
accessing the field.

@node Structure Naming Convention, Structure Implementation, Structure Usage, Structures
@subsection Structure Naming Convention
@cindex structure naming convention

The field names that come to (my) mind are often quite generic, and,
if used, would cause frequent name clashes. E.g., many structures
probably contain a @code{counter} field. The structure names
that come to (my) mind are often also the logical choice for the names
of words that create such a structure.

Therefore, I have adopted the following naming conventions: 

@itemize @bullet
@cindex field naming convention
@item
The names of fields are of the form
@code{@emph{struct}-@emph{field}}, where
@code{@emph{struct}} is the basic name of the structure, and
@code{@emph{field}} is the basic name of the field. You can
think of field words as converting the (address of the)
structure into the (address of the) field.

@cindex structure naming convention
@item
The names of structures are of the form
@code{@emph{struct}%}, where
@code{@emph{struct}} is the basic name of the structure.
@end itemize

This naming convention does not work that well for fields of extended
structures; e.g., the integer list structure has a field
@code{intlist-int}, but has @code{list-next}, not
@code{intlist-next}.

@node Structure Implementation, Structure Glossary, Structure Naming Convention, Structures
@subsection Structure Implementation
@cindex structure implementation
@cindex implementation of structures

The central idea in the implementation is to pass the data about the
structure being built on the stack, not in some global
variable. Everything else falls into place naturally once this design
decision is made.

The type description on the stack is of the form @emph{align
size}. Keeping the size on the top-of-stack makes dealing with arrays
very simple.

@code{field} is a defining word that uses @code{Create}
and @code{DOES>}. The body of the field contains the offset
of the field, and the normal @code{DOES>} action is simply:

@example
@ +
@end example

@noindent
i.e., add the offset to the address, giving the stack effect
@var{addr1 -- addr2} for a field.

@cindex first field optimization, implementation
This simple structure is slightly complicated by the optimization
for fields with offset 0, which requires a different
@code{DOES>}-part (because we cannot rely on there being
something on the stack if such a field is invoked during
compilation). Therefore, we put the different @code{DOES>}-parts
in separate words, and decide which one to invoke based on the
offset. For a zero offset, the field is basically a noop; it is
immediate, and therefore no code is generated when it is compiled.

@subsubsection Why object-oriented programming?
@cindex object-oriented programming motivation
@cindex motivation for object-oriented programming

Often we have to deal with several data structures (@emph{objects}),
that have to be treated similarly in some respects, but differently in
others. Graphical objects are the textbook example: circles, triangles,
dinosaurs, icons, and others, and we may want to add more during program
development. We want to apply some operations to any graphical object,
e.g., @code{draw} for displaying it on the screen. However, @code{draw}
has to do something different for every kind of object.
@comment TODO add some other operations eg perimeter, area
@comment and tie in to concrete examples later..

We could implement @code{draw} as a big @code{CASE}
control structure that executes the appropriate code depending on the
kind of object to be drawn. This would be not be very elegant, and,
moreover, we would have to change @code{draw} every time we add
a new kind of graphical object (say, a spaceship).

What we would rather do is: When defining spaceships, we would tell
the system: ``Here's how you @code{draw} a spaceship; you figure
out the rest''.

This is the problem that all systems solve that (rightfully) call
themselves object-oriented; the object-oriented packages presented here
solve this problem (and not much else).

@subsubsection Object-Oriented Terminology
@cindex object-oriented terminology
@cindex terminology for object-oriented programming

This section is mainly for reference, so you don't have to understand
all of it right away.  The terminology is mainly Smalltalk-inspired.  In
short:

@table @emph
@cindex class
@item class
a data structure definition with some extras.

@cindex object
@item object
an instance of the data structure described by the class definition.

@cindex instance variables
@item instance variables
fields of the data structure.

@cindex selector
@cindex method selector
@cindex virtual function
@item selector
(or @emph{method selector}) a word (e.g.,
@code{draw}) that performs an operation on a variety of data
structures (classes). A selector describes @emph{what} operation to
perform. In C++ terminology: a (pure) virtual function.

@cindex method
@item method
the concrete definition that performs the operation
described by the selector for a specific class. A method specifies
@emph{how} the operation is performed for a specific class.

@cindex selector invocation
@cindex message send
@cindex invoking a selector
@item selector invocation
a call of a selector. One argument of the call (the TOS (top-of-stack))
is used for determining which method is used. In Smalltalk terminology:
a message (consisting of the selector and the other arguments) is sent
to the object.

@cindex receiving object
@item receiving object
the object used for determining the method executed by a selector
invocation. In the @file{objects.fs} model, it is the object that is on
the TOS when the selector is invoked. (@emph{Receiving} comes from
the Smalltalk @emph{message} terminology.)

@cindex child class
@cindex parent class
@cindex inheritance
@item child class
a class that has (@emph{inherits}) all properties (instance variables,
selectors, methods) from a @emph{parent class}. In Smalltalk
terminology: The subclass inherits from the superclass. In C++
terminology: The derived class inherits from the base class.

@end table

@c If you wonder about the message sending terminology, it comes from
@c a time when each object had it's own task and objects communicated via
@c message passing; eventually the Smalltalk developers realized that
@c they can do most things through simple (indirect) calls. They kept the
@c terminology.

@node Properties of the Objects model, Basic Objects Usage, Objects, Objects
@subsubsection Properties of the @file{objects.fs} model
@cindex @file{objects.fs} properties

@itemize @bullet
@item
It is straightforward to pass objects on the stack. Passing
selectors on the stack is a little less convenient, but possible.

@item
Objects are just data structures in memory, and are referenced by their
address. You can create words for objects with normal defining words
like @code{constant}. Likewise, there is no difference between instance
variables that contain objects and those that contain other data.

@item
Late binding is efficient and easy to use.

@item
It avoids parsing, and thus avoids problems with state-smartness
and reduced extensibility; for convenience there are a few parsing
words, but they have non-parsing counterparts. There are also a few
defining words that parse. This is hard to avoid, because all standard
defining words parse (except @code{:noname}); however, such
words are not as bad as many other parsing words, because they are not
state-smart.

@item
It does not try to incorporate everything. It does a few things and does
them well (IMO). In particular, this model was not designed to support
information hiding (although it has features that may help); you can use
a separate package for achieving this.

@item
It is layered; you don't have to learn and use all features to use this
model. Only a few features are necessary (@xref{Basic Objects Usage},
@xref{The Objects base class}, @xref{Creating objects}.), the others
are optional and independent of each other.

@item
An implementation in ANS Forth is available.

@end itemize


@node Basic Objects Usage, The Objects base class, Properties of the Objects model, Objects
@subsubsection Basic @file{objects.fs} Usage
@cindex basic objects usage
@cindex objects, basic usage

You can define a class for graphical objects like this:

@cindex @code{class} usage
@cindex @code{end-class} usage
@cindex @code{selector} usage
@example
object class \ "object" is the parent class
  selector draw ( x y graphical -- )
end-class graphical
@end example

This code defines a class @code{graphical} with an
operation @code{draw}.  We can perform the operation
@code{draw} on any @code{graphical} object, e.g.:

@example
100 100 t-rex draw
@end example

@noindent
where @code{t-rex} is a word (say, a constant) that produces a
graphical object.

@comment nac TODO add a 2nd operation eg perimeter.. and use for
@comment a concrete example

@cindex abstract class
How do we create a graphical object? With the present definitions,
we cannot create a useful graphical object. The class
@code{graphical} describes graphical objects in general, but not
any concrete graphical object type (C++ users would call it an
@emph{abstract class}); e.g., there is no method for the selector
@code{draw} in the class @code{graphical}.

For concrete graphical objects, we define child classes of the
class @code{graphical}, e.g.:

@cindex @code{overrides} usage
@cindex @code{field} usage in class definition
@example
graphical class \ "graphical" is the parent class
  cell% field circle-radius

:noname ( x y circle -- )
  circle-radius @@ draw-circle ;
overrides draw

:noname ( n-radius circle -- )
  circle-radius ! ;
overrides construct

end-class circle
@end example

Here we define a class @code{circle} as a child of @code{graphical},
with field @code{circle-radius} (which behaves just like a field
(@pxref{Structures}); it defines (using @code{overrides}) new methods
for the selectors @code{draw} and @code{construct} (@code{construct} is
defined in @code{object}, the parent class of @code{graphical}).

Now we can create a circle on the heap (i.e.,
@code{allocate}d memory) with:

@cindex @code{heap-new} usage
@example
50 circle heap-new constant my-circle
@end example

@noindent
@code{heap-new} invokes @code{construct}, thus
initializing the field @code{circle-radius} with 50. We can draw
this new circle at (100,100) with:

@example
100 100 my-circle draw
@end example

@cindex selector invocation, restrictions
@cindex class definition, restrictions
Note: You can only invoke a selector if the object on the TOS
(the receiving object) belongs to the class where the selector was
defined or one of its descendents; e.g., you can invoke
@code{draw} only for objects belonging to @code{graphical}
or its descendents (e.g., @code{circle}).  Immediately before
@code{end-class}, the search order has to be the same as
immediately after @code{class}.

@node The Objects base class, Creating objects, Basic Objects Usage, Objects
@subsubsection The @file{object.fs} base class
@cindex @code{object} class

When you define a class, you have to specify a parent class.  So how do
you start defining classes? There is one class available from the start:
@code{object}. It is ancestor for all classes and so is the
only class that has no parent. It has two selectors: @code{construct}
and @code{print}.

@node Creating objects, Object-Oriented Programming Style, The Objects base class, Objects
@subsubsection Creating objects
@cindex creating objects
@cindex object creation
@cindex object allocation options

@cindex @code{heap-new} discussion
@cindex @code{dict-new} discussion
@cindex @code{construct} discussion
You can create and initialize an object of a class on the heap with
@code{heap-new} ( ... class -- object ) and in the dictionary
(allocation with @code{allot}) with @code{dict-new} (
... class -- object ). Both words invoke @code{construct}, which
consumes the stack items indicated by "..." above.

@cindex @code{init-object} discussion
@cindex @code{class-inst-size} discussion
If you want to allocate memory for an object yourself, you can get its
alignment and size with @code{class-inst-size 2@@} ( class --
align size ). Once you have memory for an object, you can initialize
it with @code{init-object} ( ... class object -- );
@code{construct} does only a part of the necessary work.

@node Object-Oriented Programming Style, Class Binding, Creating objects, Objects
@subsubsection Object-Oriented Programming Style
@cindex object-oriented programming style

This section is not exhaustive.

@cindex stack effects of selectors
@cindex selectors and stack effects
In general, it is a good idea to ensure that all methods for the
same selector have the same stack effect: when you invoke a selector,
you often have no idea which method will be invoked, so, unless all
methods have the same stack effect, you will not know the stack effect
of the selector invocation.

One exception to this rule is methods for the selector
@code{construct}. We know which method is invoked, because we
specify the class to be constructed at the same place. Actually, I
defined @code{construct} as a selector only to give the users a
convenient way to specify initialization. The way it is used, a
mechanism different from selector invocation would be more natural
(but probably would take more code and more space to explain).

@node Class Binding, Method conveniences, Object-Oriented Programming Style, Objects
@subsubsection Class Binding
@cindex class binding
@cindex early binding

@cindex late binding
Normal selector invocations determine the method at run-time depending
on the class of the receiving object. This run-time selection is called
@var{late binding}.

Sometimes it's preferable to invoke a different method. For example,
you might want to use the simple method for @code{print}ing
@code{object}s instead of the possibly long-winded @code{print} method
of the receiver class. You can achieve this by replacing the invocation
of @code{print} with:

@cindex @code{[bind]} usage
@example
[bind] object print
@end example

@noindent
in compiled code or:

@cindex @code{bind} usage
@example
bind object print
@end example

@cindex class binding, alternative to
@noindent
in interpreted code. Alternatively, you can define the method with a
name (e.g., @code{print-object}), and then invoke it through the
name. Class binding is just a (often more convenient) way to achieve
the same effect; it avoids name clutter and allows you to invoke
methods directly without naming them first.

@cindex superclass binding
@cindex parent class binding
A frequent use of class binding is this: When we define a method
for a selector, we often want the method to do what the selector does
in the parent class, and a little more. There is a special word for
this purpose: @code{[parent]}; @code{[parent]
@emph{selector}} is equivalent to @code{[bind] @emph{parent
selector}}, where @code{@emph{parent}} is the parent
class of the current class. E.g., a method definition might look like:

@cindex @code{[parent]} usage
@example
:noname
  dup [parent] foo \ do parent's foo on the receiving object
  ... \ do some more
; overrides foo
@end example

@cindex class binding as optimization
In @cite{Object-oriented programming in ANS Forth} (Forth Dimensions,
March 1997), Andrew McKewan presents class binding as an optimization
technique. I recommend not using it for this purpose unless you are in
an emergency. Late binding is pretty fast with this model anyway, so the
benefit of using class binding is small; the cost of using class binding
where it is not appropriate is reduced maintainability.

While we are at programming style questions: You should bind
selectors only to ancestor classes of the receiving object. E.g., say,
you know that the receiving object is of class @code{foo} or its
descendents; then you should bind only to @code{foo} and its
ancestors.

@node Method conveniences, Classes and Scoping, Class Binding, Objects
@subsubsection Method conveniences
@cindex method conveniences

In a method you usually access the receiving object pretty often.  If
you define the method as a plain colon definition (e.g., with
@code{:noname}), you may have to do a lot of stack
gymnastics. To avoid this, you can define the method with @code{m:
... ;m}. E.g., you could define the method for
@code{draw}ing a @code{circle} with

@cindex @code{this} usage
@cindex @code{m:} usage
@cindex @code{;m} usage
@example
m: ( x y circle -- )
  ( x y ) this circle-radius @@ draw-circle ;m
@end example

@cindex @code{exit} in @code{m: ... ;m}
@cindex @code{exitm} discussion
@cindex @code{catch} in @code{m: ... ;m}
When this method is executed, the receiver object is removed from the
stack; you can access it with @code{this} (admittedly, in this
example the use of @code{m: ... ;m} offers no advantage). Note
that I specify the stack effect for the whole method (i.e. including
the receiver object), not just for the code between @code{m:}
and @code{;m}. You cannot use @code{exit} in
@code{m:...;m}; instead, use
@code{exitm}.@footnote{Moreover, for any word that calls
@code{catch} and was defined before loading
@code{objects.fs}, you have to redefine it like I redefined
@code{catch}: @code{: catch this >r catch r> to-this ;}}

@cindex @code{inst-var} usage
You will frequently use sequences of the form @code{this
@emph{field}} (in the example above: @code{this
circle-radius}). If you use the field only in this way, you can
define it with @code{inst-var} and eliminate the
@code{this} before the field name. E.g., the @code{circle}
class above could also be defined with:

@example
graphical class
  cell% inst-var radius

m: ( x y circle -- )
  radius @@ draw-circle ;m
overrides draw

m: ( n-radius circle -- )
  radius ! ;m
overrides construct

end-class circle
@end example

@code{radius} can only be used in @code{circle} and its
descendent classes and inside @code{m:...;m}.

@cindex @code{inst-value} usage
You can also define fields with @code{inst-value}, which is
to @code{inst-var} what @code{value} is to
@code{variable}.  You can change the value of such a field with
@code{[to-inst]}.  E.g., we could also define the class
@code{circle} like this:

@example
graphical class
  inst-value radius

m: ( x y circle -- )
  radius draw-circle ;m
overrides draw

m: ( n-radius circle -- )
  [to-inst] radius ;m
overrides construct

end-class circle
@end example


@node Classes and Scoping, Object Interfaces, Method conveniences, Objects
@subsubsection Classes and Scoping
@cindex classes and scoping
@cindex scoping and classes

Inheritance is frequent, unlike structure extension. This exacerbates
the problem with the field name convention (@pxref{Structure Naming
Convention}): One always has to remember in which class the field was
originally defined; changing a part of the class structure would require
changes for renaming in otherwise unaffected code.

@cindex @code{inst-var} visibility
@cindex @code{inst-value} visibility
To solve this problem, I added a scoping mechanism (which was not in my
original charter): A field defined with @code{inst-var} (or
@code{inst-value}) is visible only in the class where it is defined and in
the descendent classes of this class.  Using such fields only makes
sense in @code{m:}-defined methods in these classes anyway.

This scoping mechanism allows us to use the unadorned field name,
because name clashes with unrelated words become much less likely.

@cindex @code{protected} discussion
@cindex @code{private} discussion
Once we have this mechanism, we can also use it for controlling the
visibility of other words: All words defined after
@code{protected} are visible only in the current class and its
descendents. @code{public} restores the compilation
(i.e. @code{current}) word list that was in effect before. If you
have several @code{protected}s without an intervening
@code{public} or @code{set-current}, @code{public}
will restore the compilation word list in effect before the first of
these @code{protected}s.

@node Object Interfaces, Objects Implementation, Classes and Scoping, Objects
@subsubsection Object Interfaces
@cindex object interfaces
@cindex interfaces for objects

In this model you can only call selectors defined in the class of the
receiving objects or in one of its ancestors. If you call a selector
with a receiving object that is not in one of these classes, the
result is undefined; if you are lucky, the program crashes
immediately.

@cindex selectors common to hardly-related classes
Now consider the case when you want to have a selector (or several)
available in two classes: You would have to add the selector to a
common ancestor class, in the worst case to @code{object}. You
may not want to do this, e.g., because someone else is responsible for
this ancestor class.

The solution for this problem is interfaces. An interface is a
collection of selectors. If a class implements an interface, the
selectors become available to the class and its descendents. A class
can implement an unlimited number of interfaces. For the problem
discussed above, we would define an interface for the selector(s), and
both classes would implement the interface.

As an example, consider an interface @code{storage} for
writing objects to disk and getting them back, and a class
@code{foo} that implements it. The code would look like this:

@cindex @code{interface} usage
@cindex @code{end-interface} usage
@cindex @code{implementation} usage
@example
interface
  selector write ( file object -- )
  selector read1 ( file object -- )
end-interface storage

bar class
  storage implementation

... overrides write
... overrides read
...
end-class foo
@end example

@noindent
(I would add a word @code{read} @var{( file -- object )} that uses
@code{read1} internally, but that's beyond the point illustrated
here.)

Note that you cannot use @code{protected} in an interface; and
of course you cannot define fields.

In the Neon model, all selectors are available for all classes;
therefore it does not need interfaces. The price you pay in this model
is slower late binding, and therefore, added complexity to avoid late
binding.

@subsubsection @file{objects.fs} Implementation
@cindex @file{objects.fs} implementation

@cindex @code{object-map} discussion
An object is a piece of memory, like one of the data structures
described with @code{struct...end-struct}. It has a field
@code{object-map} that points to the method map for the object's
class.

@cindex method map
@cindex virtual function table
The @emph{method map}@footnote{This is Self terminology; in C++
terminology: virtual function table.} is an array that contains the
execution tokens (@var{xt}s) of the methods for the object's class. Each
selector contains an offset into a method map.

@cindex @code{selector} implementation, class
@code{selector} is a defining word that uses
@code{CREATE} and @code{DOES>}. The body of the
selector contains the offset; the @code{does>} action for a
class selector is, basically:

@example
( object addr ) @@ over object-map @@ + @@ execute
@end example

Since @code{object-map} is the first field of the object, it
does not generate any code. As you can see, calling a selector has a
small, constant cost.

@cindex @code{current-interface} discussion
@cindex class implementation and representation
A class is basically a @code{struct} combined with a method
map. During the class definition the alignment and size of the class
are passed on the stack, just as with @code{struct}s, so
@code{field} can also be used for defining class
fields. However, passing more items on the stack would be
inconvenient, so @code{class} builds a data structure in memory,
which is accessed through the variable
@code{current-interface}. After its definition is complete, the
class is represented on the stack by a pointer (e.g., as parameter for
a child class definition).

A new class starts off with the alignment and size of its parent,
and a copy of the parent's method map. Defining new fields extends the
size and alignment; likewise, defining new selectors extends the
method map. @code{overrides} just stores a new @var{xt} in the method
map at the offset given by the selector.

@cindex class binding, implementation
Class binding just gets the @var{xt} at the offset given by the selector
from the class's method map and @code{compile,}s (in the case of
@code{[bind]}) it.

@cindex @code{this} implementation
@cindex @code{catch} and @code{this}
@cindex @code{this} and @code{catch}
I implemented @code{this} as a @code{value}. At the
start of an @code{m:...;m} method the old @code{this} is
stored to the return stack and restored at the end; and the object on
the TOS is stored @code{TO this}. This technique has one
disadvantage: If the user does not leave the method via
@code{;m}, but via @code{throw} or @code{exit},
@code{this} is not restored (and @code{exit} may
crash). To deal with the @code{throw} problem, I have redefined
@code{catch} to save and restore @code{this}; the same
should be done with any word that can catch an exception. As for
@code{exit}, I simply forbid it (as a replacement, there is
@code{exitm}).

@cindex @code{inst-var} implementation
@code{inst-var} is just the same as @code{field}, with
a different @code{DOES>} action:
@example
@@ this +
@end example
Similar for @code{inst-value}.

@cindex class scoping implementation
Each class also has a word list that contains the words defined with
@code{inst-var} and @code{inst-value}, and its protected
words. It also has a pointer to its parent. @code{class} pushes
the word lists of the class and all its ancestors onto the search order stack,
and @code{end-class} drops them.

@cindex interface implementation
An interface is like a class without fields, parent and protected
words; i.e., it just has a method map. If a class implements an
interface, its method map contains a pointer to the method map of the
interface. The positive offsets in the map are reserved for class
methods, therefore interface map pointers have negative
offsets. Interfaces have offsets that are unique throughout the
system, unlike class selectors, whose offsets are only unique for the
classes where the selector is available (invokable).

This structure means that interface selectors have to perform one
indirection more than class selectors to find their method. Their body
contains the interface map pointer offset in the class method map, and
the method offset in the interface method map. The
@code{does>} action for an interface selector is, basically:

@example
( object selector-body )
2dup selector-interface @@ ( object selector-body object interface-offset )
swap object-map @@ + @@ ( object selector-body map )
swap selector-offset @@ + @@ execute
@end example

where @code{object-map} and @code{selector-offset} are
first fields and generate no code.

As a concrete example, consider the following code:

@example
interface
  selector if1sel1
  selector if1sel2
end-interface if1

object class
  if1 implementation
  selector cl1sel1
  cell% inst-var cl1iv1

' m1 overrides construct
' m2 overrides if1sel1
' m3 overrides if1sel2
' m4 overrides cl1sel2
end-class cl1

create obj1 object dict-new drop
create obj2 cl1    dict-new drop
@end example

The data structure created by this code (including the data structure
for @code{object}) is shown in the <a
href="objects-implementation.eps">figure</a>, assuming a cell size of 4.

@itemize @bullet
@item
This model combines object oriented programming with information
hiding. It helps you writing large application, where scoping is
necessary, because it provides class-oriented scoping.

@item
Named objects, object pointers, and object arrays can be created,
selector invocation uses the ``object selector'' syntax. Selector invocation
to objects and/or selectors on the stack is a bit less convenient, but
possible.

@item
Selector invocation and instance variable usage of the active object is
straightforward, since both make use of the active object.

@item
Late binding is efficient and easy to use.

@item
State-smart objects parse selectors. However, extensibility is provided
using a (parsing) selector @code{postpone} and a selector @code{'}.

@item
An implementation in ANS Forth is available.

@subsubsection Basic @file{oof.fs} Usage
@cindex @file{oof.fs} usage

This section uses the same example as for @code{objects} (@pxref{Basic Objects Usage}).

You can define a class for graphical objects like this:

@cindex @code{class} usage
@cindex @code{class;} usage
@cindex @code{method} usage
@example
object class graphical \ "object" is the parent class
  method draw ( x y graphical -- )
class;
@end example

This code defines a class @code{graphical} with an
operation @code{draw}.  We can perform the operation
@code{draw} on any @code{graphical} object, e.g.:

@example
100 100 t-rex draw
@end example

@noindent
where @code{t-rex} is an object or object pointer, created with e.g.
@code{graphical : t-rex}.

@cindex abstract class
How do we create a graphical object? With the present definitions,
we cannot create a useful graphical object. The class
@code{graphical} describes graphical objects in general, but not
any concrete graphical object type (C++ users would call it an
@emph{abstract class}); e.g., there is no method for the selector
@code{draw} in the class @code{graphical}.

For concrete graphical objects, we define child classes of the
class @code{graphical}, e.g.:

@example
graphical class circle \ "graphical" is the parent class
  cell var circle-radius
how:
  : draw ( x y -- )
    circle-radius @@ draw-circle ;

  : init ( n-radius -- (
    circle-radius ! ;
class;
@end example

Here we define a class @code{circle} as a child of @code{graphical},
with a field @code{circle-radius}; it defines new methods for the
selectors @code{draw} and @code{init} (@code{init} is defined in
@code{object}, the parent class of @code{graphical}).

Now we can create a circle in the dictionary with:

@example
50 circle : my-circle
@end example

@noindent
@code{:} invokes @code{init}, thus initializing the field
@code{circle-radius} with 50. We can draw this new circle at (100,100)
with:

@example
100 100 my-circle draw
@end example

@cindex selector invocation, restrictions
@cindex class definition, restrictions
Note: You can only invoke a selector if the receiving object belongs to
the class where the selector was defined or one of its descendents;
e.g., you can invoke @code{draw} only for objects belonging to
@code{graphical} or its descendents (e.g., @code{circle}). The scoping
mechanism will check if you try to invoke a selector that is not
defined in this class hierarchy, so you'll get an error at compilation
time.


@node The OOF base class, Class Declaration, Basic OOF Usage, OOF
@subsubsection The @file{oof.fs} base class
@cindex @file{oof.fs} base class

When you define a class, you have to specify a parent class.  So how do
you start defining classes? There is one class available from the start:
@code{object}. You have to use it as ancestor for all classes. It is the
only class that has no parent. Classes are also objects, except that
they don't have instance variables; class manipulation such as
inheritance or changing definitions of a class is handled through
selectors of the class @code{object}.

@code{object} provides a number of selectors:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{class} for subclassing, @code{definitions} to add definitions
later on, and @code{class?} to get type informations (is the class a
subclass of the class passed on the stack?).
doc---object-class
doc---object-definitions
doc---object-class?

@item
@code{init} and @code{dispose} as constructor and destructor of the
object. @code{init} is invocated after the object's memory is allocated,
while @code{dispose} also handles deallocation. Thus if you redefine
@code{dispose}, you have to call the parent's dispose with @code{super
dispose}, too.
doc---object-init
doc---object-dispose

@item
@code{new}, @code{new[]}, @code{:}, @code{ptr}, @code{asptr}, and
@code{[]} to create named and unnamed objects and object arrays or
object pointers.
doc---object-new
doc---object-new[]
doc---object-:
doc---object-ptr
doc---object-asptr
doc---object-[]

@item
@code{::} and @code{super} for explicit scoping. You should use explicit
scoping only for super classes or classes with the same set of instance
variables. Explicitly-scoped selectors use early binding.
doc---object-::
doc---object-super

@item
@code{self} to get the address of the object
doc---object-self

@item
@code{bind}, @code{bound}, @code{link}, and @code{is} to assign object
pointers and instance defers.
doc---object-bind
doc---object-bound
doc---object-link
doc---object-is

@item
@code{'} to obtain selector tokens, @code{send} to invocate selectors
form the stack, and @code{postpone} to generate selector invocation code.
doc---object-'
doc---object-postpone

@item
@code{with} and @code{endwith} to select the active object from the
stack, and enable its scope. Using @code{with} and @code{endwith}
also allows you to create code using selector @code{postpone} without being
trapped by the state-smart objects.

Gforth's third object oriented Forth package is a 12-liner. It uses a
mixture of the @file{object.fs} and the @file{oof.fs} syntax,
and reduces to the bare minimum of features. This is based on a posting

@cindex mini-oof example

A short example shows how to use this package. This example, in slightly
extended form, is supplied as @file{moof-exm.fs}
@comment nac TODO could flesh this out with some comments from the Forthwrite article

@example
object class
  method init
  method draw
end-class graphical
@end example

This code defines a class @code{graphical} with an
operation @code{draw}.  We can perform the operation
@code{draw} on any @code{graphical} object, e.g.:

@example
100 100 t-rex draw
@end example

where @code{t-rex} is an object or object pointer, created with e.g.
@code{graphical new Constant t-rex}.

For concrete graphical objects, we define child classes of the
class @code{graphical}, e.g.:

@example
graphical class
  cell var circle-radius
end-class circle \ "graphical" is the parent class

:noname ( x y -- )
  circle-radius @@ draw-circle ; circle defines draw
:noname ( r -- )
  circle-radius ! ; circle defines init
@end example

There is no implicit init method, so we have to define one. The creation
code of the object now has to call init explicitely.

@example
circle new Constant my-circle
50 my-circle init
@end example

It is also possible to add a function to create named objects with
automatic call of @code{init}, given that all objects have @code{init}
on the same place:

@example
: new: ( .. o "name" -- )
    new dup Constant init ;
80 circle new: large-circle
@end example

We can draw this new circle at (100,100) with:

@example
100 100 my-circle draw
@end example

@node Mini-OOF Implementation, , Mini-OOF Example, Mini-OOF
@subsubsection @file{mini-oof.fs} Implementation

Object-oriented systems with late binding typically use a
``vtable''-approach: the first variable in each object is a pointer to a
table, which contains the methods as function pointers. The vtable
may also contain other information.

So first, let's declare methods:

@example
: method ( m v -- m' v ) Create  over , swap cell+ swap
  DOES> ( ... o -- ... ) @ over @ + @ execute ;
@end example

During method declaration, the number of methods and instance
variables is on the stack (in address units). @code{method} creates
one method and increments the method number. To execute a method, it
takes the object, fetches the vtable pointer, adds the offset, and
executes the @var{xt} stored there. Each method takes the object it is
invoked from as top of stack parameter. The method itself should
consume that object.

Now, we also have to declare instance variables

@example
: var ( m v size -- m v' ) Create  over , +
  DOES> ( o -- addr ) @ + ;
@end example

As before, a word is created with the current offset. Instance
variables can have different sizes (cells, floats, doubles, chars), so
all we do is take the size and add it to the offset. If your machine
has alignment restrictions, put the proper @code{aligned} or
@code{faligned} before the variable, to adjust the variable
offset. That's why it is on the top of stack.

We need a starting point (the base object) and some syntactic sugar:

@example
Create object  1 cells , 2 cells ,
: class ( class -- class methods vars ) dup 2@ ;
@end example

For inheritance, the vtable of the parent object has to be
copied when a new, derived class is declared. This gives all the
methods of the parent class, which can be overridden, though.

@example
: end-class  ( class methods vars -- )
  Create  here >r , dup , 2 cells ?DO ['] noop , 1 cells +LOOP
  cell+ dup cell+ r> rot @ 2 cells /string move ;
@end example

The first line creates the vtable, initialized with
@code{noop}s. The second line is the inheritance mechanism, it
copies the xts from the parent vtable.

We still have no way to define new methods, let's do that now:

@example
: defines ( xt class -- ) ' >body @ + ! ;
@end example

To allocate a new object, we need a word, too:

@example
: new ( class -- o )  here over @ allot swap over ! ;
@end example

Sometimes derived classes want to access the method of the
parent object. There are two ways to achieve this with Mini-OOF:
first, you could use named words, and second, you could look up the
vtable of the parent object.

@example
: :: ( class "name" -- ) ' >body @ + @ compile, ;
@end example


Nothing can be more confusing than a good example, so here is
one. First let's declare a text object (called
@code{button}), that stores text and position:

@example
object class
  cell var text
  cell var len
  cell var x
  cell var y
  method init
  method draw
end-class button
@end example

@noindent
Now, implement the two methods, @code{draw} and @code{init}:

@example
:noname ( o -- )
 >r r@ x @ r@ y @ at-xy  r@ text @ r> len @ type ;
 button defines draw
:noname ( addr u o -- )
 >r 0 r@ x ! 0 r@ y ! r@ len ! r> text ! ;
 button defines init
@end example

@noindent
To demonstrate inheritance, we define a class @code{bold-button}, with no
new data and no new methods:

@example
button class
end-class bold-button

: bold   27 emit ." [1m" ;
: normal 27 emit ." [0m" ;
@end example

@noindent
The class @code{bold-button} has a different draw method to
@code{button}, but the new method is defined in terms of the draw method
for @code{button}:

@example
:noname bold [ button :: draw ] normal ; bold-button defines draw
@end example

@noindent
Finally, create two objects and apply methods:

@example
button new Constant foo
s" thin foo" foo init
page
foo draw
bold-button new Constant bar
s" fat bar" bar init
1 bar y !
bar draw
@end example


@node Comparison with other object models, , Mini-OOF, Object-oriented Forth
@subsubsection Comparison with other object models
@cindex comparison of object models
@cindex object models, comparison

Many object-oriented Forth extensions have been proposed (@cite{A survey
of object-oriented Forths} (SIGPLAN Notices, April 1996) by Bradford
J. Rodriguez and W. F. S. Poehlman lists 17). This section discusses the
relation of the object models described here to two well-known and two
closely-related (by the use of method maps) models.

@cindex Neon model
The most popular model currently seems to be the Neon model (see
@cite{Object-oriented programming in ANS Forth} (Forth Dimensions, March
1997) by Andrew McKewan) but this model has a number of limitations
@footnote{A longer version of this critique can be
found in @cite{On Standardizing Object-Oriented Forth Extensions} (Forth
Dimensions, May 1997) by Anton Ertl.}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
It uses a @code{@emph{selector
object}} syntax, which makes it unnatural to pass objects on the
stack.

@item
It requires that the selector parses the input stream (at
compile time); this leads to reduced extensibility and to bugs that are+
hard to find.

@item
It allows using every selector to every object;
this eliminates the need for classes, but makes it harder to create
efficient implementations. 
@end itemize

@cindex Pountain's object-oriented model
Another well-known publication is @cite{Object-Oriented Forth} (Academic
Press, London, 1987) by Dick Pountain. However, it is not really about
object-oriented programming, because it hardly deals with late
binding. Instead, it focuses on features like information hiding and
overloading that are characteristic of modular languages like Ada (83).

@cindex Zsoter's object-oriented model
In @cite{Does late binding have to be slow?} (Forth Dimensions 18(1) 1996, pages 31-35)
Andras Zsoter describes a model that makes heavy use of an active object
(like @code{this} in @file{objects.fs}): The active object is not only
used for accessing all fields, but also specifies the receiving object
of every selector invocation; you have to change the active object
explicitly with @code{@{ ... @}}, whereas in @file{objects.fs} it
changes more or less implicitly at @code{m: ... ;m}. Such a change at
the method entry point is unnecessary with the Zsoter's model, because
the receiving object is the active object already. On the other hand, the explicit
change is absolutely necessary in that model, because otherwise no one
could ever change the active object. An ANS Forth implementation of this
model is available at @url{http://www.forth.org/fig/oopf.html}.

@cindex @file{oof.fs}, differences to other models
The @file{oof.fs} model combines information hiding and overloading
resolution (by keeping names in various word lists) with object-oriented
programming. It sets the active object implicitly on method entry, but
also allows explicit changing (with @code{>o...o>} or with
@code{with...endwith}). It uses parsing and state-smart objects and
classes for resolving overloading and for early binding: the object or
class parses the selector and determines the method from this. If the
selector is not parsed by an object or class, it performs a call to the
selector for the active object (late binding), like Zsoter's model.
Fields are always accessed through the active object. The big
disadvantage of this model is the parsing and the state-smartness, which
reduces extensibility and increases the opportunities for subtle bugs;
essentially, you are only safe if you never tick or @code{postpone} an
object or class (Bernd disagrees, but I (Anton) am not convinced).

@cindex @file{mini-oof.fs}, differences to other models
The @file{mini-oof.fs} model is quite similar to a very stripped-down version of
the @file{objects.fs} model, but syntactically it is a mixture of the @file{objects.fs} and
@file{oof.fs} models.

./xxx.fs:4: Invalid memory address
bar
^^^
$400E664C @@
$400E6664 foo
@end example

The message identifying the error is @code{Invalid memory address}.  The
error happened when text-interpreting line 4 of the file
@file{./xxx.fs}. This line is given (it contains @code{bar}), and the
word on the line where the error happened, is pointed out (with
@code{^^^}).

The file containing the error was included in line 1 of @file{./yyy.fs},
and @file{yyy.fs} was included from a non-file (in this case, by giving
@file{yyy.fs} as command-line parameter to Gforth).

At the end of the error message you find a return stack dump that can be
interpreted as a backtrace (possibly empty). On top you find the top of
the return stack when the @code{throw} happened, and at the bottom you
find the return stack entry just above the return stack of the topmost
text interpreter.

To the right of most return stack entries you see a guess for the word
that pushed that return stack entry as its return address. This gives a
backtrace. In our case we see that @code{bar} called @code{foo}, and
@code{foo} called @code{@@} (and @code{@@} had an @emph{Invalid memory
address} exception).

Note that the backtrace is not perfect: We don't know which return stack
entries are return addresses (so we may get false positives); and in
some cases (e.g., for @code{abort"}) we cannot determine from the return
address the word that pushed the return address, so for some return
addresses you see no names in the return stack dump.

@cindex @code{catch} and backtraces
The return stack dump represents the return stack at the time when a
specific @code{throw} was executed.  In programs that make use of
@code{catch}, it is not necessarily clear which @code{throw} should be
used for the return stack dump (e.g., consider one @code{throw} that
indicates an error, which is caught, and during recovery another error
happens; which @code{throw} should be used for the stack dump).  Gforth
presents the return stack dump for the first @code{throw} after the last
executed (not returned-to) @code{catch}; this works well in the usual
case.

@cindex @code{gforth-fast} and backtraces
@cindex @code{gforth-fast}, difference from @code{gforth}
@cindex backtraces with @code{gforth-fast}
@cindex return stack dump with @code{gforth-fast}
@code{gforth} is able to do a return stack dump for throws generated
from primitives (e.g., invalid memory address, stack empty etc.);
@code{gforth-fast} is only able to do a return stack dump from a
directly called @code{throw} (including @code{abort} etc.).  This is the
only difference (apart from a speed difference of about 30%) between
@code{gforth} and @code{gforth-fast}.  Given an exception caused by a
primitive in @code{gforth-fast}, you will typically see no return stack
dump at all; however, if the exception is caught by @code{catch} (e.g.,
for restoring some state), and then @code{throw}n again, the return
stack dump will be for the first such @code{throw}.

@section @file{ans-report.fs}: Report the words used, sorted by wordset
@cindex @file{ans-report.fs}
@cindex report the words used in your program
@cindex words used in your program

If you want to label a Forth program as ANS Forth Program, you must
document which wordsets the program uses; for extension wordsets, it is
helpful to list the words the program requires from these wordsets
(because Forth systems are allowed to provide only some words of them).

The @file{ans-report.fs} tool makes it easy for you to determine which
words from which wordset and which non-ANS words your application
uses. You simply have to include @file{ans-report.fs} before loading the
program you want to check. After loading your program, you can get the
report with @code{print-ans-report}. A typical use is to run this as
batch job like this:
@example
gforth ans-report.fs myprog.fs -e "print-ans-report bye"
@end example

The output looks like this (for @file{compat/control.fs}):
@example
The program uses the following words
from CORE :
: POSTPONE THEN ; immediate ?dup IF 0= 
from BLOCK-EXT :
\ 
from FILE :
( 
@end example

@subsection Caveats

Note that @file{ans-report.fs} just checks which words are used, not whether
they are used in an ANS Forth conforming way!

Some words are defined in several wordsets in the
standard. @file{ans-report.fs} reports them for only one of the
wordsets, and not necessarily the one you expect. It depends on usage
which wordset is the right one to specify. E.g., if you only use the
compilation semantics of @code{S"}, it is a Core word; if you also use
its interpretation semantics, it is a File word.

@cindex system documentation
In addition, ANS Forth systems are required to document certain
implementation choices. This chapter tries to meet these
requirements. In many cases it gives a way to ask the system for the
information instead of providing the information directly, in
particular, if the information depends on the processor, the operating
system or the installation options chosen, or if they are likely to
change during the maintenance of Gforth.

@comment The framework for the rest has been taken from pfe.

@item (Cell) aligned addresses:
@cindex cell-aligned addresses
@cindex aligned addresses
processor-dependent. Gforth's alignment words perform natural alignment
(e.g., an address aligned for a datum of size 8 is divisible by
8). Unaligned accesses usually result in a @code{-23 THROW}.

@item @code{EMIT} and non-graphic characters:
@cindex @code{EMIT} and non-graphic characters
@cindex non-graphic characters and @code{EMIT}
The character is output using the C library function (actually, macro)
@code{putc}.

@cindex character editing of @code{ACCEPT} and @code{EXPECT}
@cindex editing in @code{ACCEPT} and @code{EXPECT}
@cindex @code{ACCEPT}, editing
@cindex @code{EXPECT}, editing
This is modeled on the GNU readline library (@pxref{Readline
Interaction, , Command Line Editing, readline, The GNU Readline
Library}) with Emacs-like key bindings. @kbd{Tab} deviates a little by
producing a full word completion every time you type it (instead of
producing the common prefix of all completions).

@item character set:
@cindex character set
The character set of your computer and display device. Gforth is
8-bit-clean (but some other component in your system may make trouble).

@item Character-aligned address requirements:
@cindex character-aligned address requirements
installation-dependent. Currently a character is represented by a C
@code{unsigned char}; in the future we might switch to @code{wchar_t}
(Comments on that requested).

@item character-set extensions and matching of names:
@cindex character-set extensions and matching of names
@cindex case-sensitivity for name lookup
@cindex name lookup, case-sensitivity
@cindex locale and case-sensitivity
Any character except the ASCII NUL character can be used in a
name. Matching is case-insensitive (except in @code{TABLE}s). The
matching is performed using the C function @code{strncasecmp}, whose
function is probably influenced by the locale. E.g., the @code{C} locale
does not know about accents and umlauts, so they are matched
case-sensitively in that locale. For portability reasons it is best to
write programs such that they work in the @code{C} locale. Then one can
use libraries written by a Polish programmer (who might use words
containing ISO Latin-2 encoded characters) and by a French programmer
(ISO Latin-1) in the same program (of course, @code{WORDS} will produce
funny results for some of the words (which ones, depends on the font you
are using)). Also, the locale you prefer may not be available in other
operating systems. Hopefully, Unicode will solve these problems one day.

@item conditions under which control characters match a space delimiter:
@cindex space delimiters
@cindex control characters as delimiters
If @code{WORD} is called with the space character as a delimiter, all
white-space characters (as identified by the C macro @code{isspace()})
are delimiters. @code{PARSE}, on the other hand, treats space like other
delimiters. @code{PARSE-WORD} treats space like @code{WORD}, but behaves
like @code{PARSE} otherwise. @code{(NAME)}, which is used by the outer
interpreter (aka text interpreter) by default, treats all white-space
characters as delimiters.

@item format of the control-flow stack:
@cindex control-flow stack, format
The data stack is used as control-flow stack. The size of a control-flow
stack item in cells is given by the constant @code{cs-item-size}. At the
time of this writing, an item consists of a (pointer to a) locals list
(third), an address in the code (second), and a tag for identifying the
item (TOS). The following tags are used: @code{defstart},
@code{live-orig}, @code{dead-orig}, @code{dest}, @code{do-dest},
@code{scopestart}.

@item conversion of digits > 35
@cindex digits > 35
The characters @code{[\]^_'} are the digits with the decimal value
36@minus{}41. There is no way to input many of the larger digits.

@item display after input terminates in @code{ACCEPT} and @code{EXPECT}:
@cindex @code{EXPECT}, display after end of input
@cindex @code{ACCEPT}, display after end of input
The cursor is moved to the end of the entered string. If the input is
terminated using the @kbd{Return} key, a space is typed.

@item exception abort sequence of @code{ABORT"}:
@cindex exception abort sequence of @code{ABORT"}
@cindex @code{ABORT"}, exception abort sequence
The error string is stored into the variable @code{"error} and a
@code{-2 throw} is performed.

@item input line terminator:
@cindex input line terminator
@cindex line terminator on input
@cindex newline character on input
For interactive input, @kbd{C-m} (CR) and @kbd{C-j} (LF) terminate
lines. One of these characters is typically produced when you type the
@kbd{Enter} or @kbd{Return} key.

@item maximum size of a counted string:
@cindex maximum size of a counted string
@cindex counted string, maximum size
@code{s" /counted-string" environment? drop .}. Currently 255 characters

@item method of selecting the user input device:
@cindex user input device, method of selecting
The user input device is the standard input. There is currently no way to
change it from within Gforth. However, the input can typically be
redirected in the command line that starts Gforth.

@item method of selecting the user output device:
@cindex user output device, method of selecting
@code{EMIT} and @code{TYPE} output to the file-id stored in the value
@code{outfile-id} (@code{stdout} by default). Gforth uses unbuffered
output when the user output device is a terminal, otherwise the output
is buffered.

What are we expected to document here?

@item number of bits in one address unit:
@cindex number of bits in one address unit
@cindex address unit, size in bits
@code{s" address-units-bits" environment? drop .}. 8 in all current

@cindex number representation and arithmetic
Processor-dependent. Binary two's complement on all current ports.

@item ranges for integer types:
@cindex ranges for integer types
@cindex integer types, ranges
Installation-dependent. Make environmental queries for @code{MAX-N},
@code{MAX-U}, @code{MAX-D} and @code{MAX-UD}. The lower bounds for
unsigned (and positive) types is 0. The lower bound for signed types on
two's complement and one's complement machines machines can be computed
by adding 1 to the upper bound.

@item read-only data space regions:
@cindex read-only data space regions
@cindex data-space, read-only regions
The whole Forth data space is writable.

@item size of buffer at @code{WORD}:
@cindex size of buffer at @code{WORD}
@cindex @code{WORD} buffer size
@code{PAD HERE - .}. 104 characters on 32-bit machines. The buffer is
shared with the pictured numeric output string. If overwriting
@code{PAD} is acceptable, it is as large as the remaining dictionary
space, although only as much can be sensibly used as fits in a counted
string.

@item size of one cell in address units:
@cindex cell size
@code{1 cells .}.

@item size of one character in address units:
@cindex char size
@code{1 chars .}. 1 on all current ports.

@item size of the keyboard terminal buffer:
@cindex size of the keyboard terminal buffer
@cindex terminal buffer, size
Varies. You can determine the size at a specific time using @code{lp@@
tib - .}. It is shared with the locals stack and TIBs of files that
include the current file. You can change the amount of space for TIBs
and locals stack at Gforth startup with the command line option
@code{-l}.

@item size of the pictured numeric output buffer:
@cindex size of the pictured numeric output buffer
@cindex pictured numeric output buffer, size
@code{PAD HERE - .}. 104 characters on 32-bit machines. The buffer is
shared with @code{WORD}.

@item size of the scratch area returned by @code{PAD}:
@cindex size of the scratch area returned by @code{PAD}
@cindex @code{PAD} size
The remainder of dictionary space. @code{unused pad here - - .}.

@item system case-sensitivity characteristics:
@cindex case-sensitivity characteristics
Dictionary searches are case-insensitive (except in
@code{TABLE}s). However, as explained above under @i{character-set
extensions}, the matching for non-ASCII characters is determined by the
locale you are using. In the default @code{C} locale all non-ASCII
characters are matched case-sensitively.

@item system prompt:
@cindex system prompt
@cindex prompt
@code{ ok} in interpret state, @code{ compiled} in compile state.

@item division rounding:
@cindex division rounding
installation dependent. @code{s" floored" environment? drop .}. We leave
the choice to @code{gcc} (what to use for @code{/}) and to you (whether
to use @code{fm/mod}, @code{sm/rem} or simply @code{/}).

@item values of @code{STATE} when true:
@cindex @code{STATE} values
-1.

@item values returned after arithmetic overflow:
On two's complement machines, arithmetic is performed modulo
2**bits-per-cell for single arithmetic and 4**bits-per-cell for double
arithmetic (with appropriate mapping for signed types). Division by zero
typically results in a @code{-55 throw} (Floating-point unidentified
fault), although a @code{-10 throw} (divide by zero) would be more
appropriate.

@item whether the current definition can be found after @t{DOES>}:
@cindex @t{DOES>}, visibility of current definition
No.

@table @i

@item a name is neither a word nor a number:
@cindex name not found
@cindex undefined word
@code{-13 throw} (Undefined word). Actually, @code{-13 bounce}, which
preserves the data and FP stack, so you don't lose more work than
necessary.

@item a definition name exceeds the maximum length allowed:
@cindex word name too long
@code{-19 throw} (Word name too long)

@item addressing a region not inside the various data spaces of the forth system:
@cindex Invalid memory address
The stacks, code space and name space are accessible. Machine code space is
typically readable. Accessing other addresses gives results dependent on
the operating system. On decent systems: @code{-9 throw} (Invalid memory
address).

@item argument type incompatible with parameter:
@cindex argument type mismatch
This is usually not caught. Some words perform checks, e.g., the control
flow words, and issue a @code{ABORT"} or @code{-12 THROW} (Argument type
mismatch).

@item attempting to obtain the execution token of a word with undefined execution semantics:
@cindex Interpreting a compile-only word, for @code{'} etc.
@cindex execution token of words with undefined execution semantics
@code{-14 throw} (Interpreting a compile-only word). In some cases, you
get an execution token for @code{compile-only-error} (which performs a
@code{-14 throw} when executed).

@item dividing by zero:
@cindex dividing by zero
@cindex floating point unidentified fault, integer division
On better platforms, this produces a @code{-10 throw} (Division by
zero); on other systems, this typically results in a @code{-55 throw}
(Floating-point unidentified fault).

@item insufficient data stack or return stack space:
@cindex insufficient data stack or return stack space
@cindex stack overflow
@cindex address alignment exception, stack overflow
@cindex Invalid memory address, stack overflow
Depending on the operating system, the installation, and the invocation
of Gforth, this is either checked by the memory management hardware, or
it is not checked. If it is checked, you typically get a @code{-3 throw}
(Stack overflow), @code{-5 throw} (Return stack overflow), or @code{-9
throw} (Invalid memory address) (depending on the platform and how you
achieved the overflow) as soon as the overflow happens. If it is not
checked, overflows typically result in mysterious illegal memory
accesses, producing @code{-9 throw} (Invalid memory address) or
@code{-23 throw} (Address alignment exception); they might also destroy
the internal data structure of @code{ALLOCATE} and friends, resulting in
various errors in these words.

@item insufficient space for loop control parameters:
@cindex insufficient space for loop control parameters
like other return stack overflows.

@item insufficient space in the dictionary:
@cindex insufficient space in the dictionary
@cindex dictionary overflow
If you try to allot (either directly with @code{allot}, or indirectly
with @code{,}, @code{create} etc.) more memory than available in the
dictionary, you get a @code{-8 throw} (Dictionary overflow). If you try
to access memory beyond the end of the dictionary, the results are
similar to stack overflows.

@item interpreting a word with undefined interpretation semantics:
@cindex interpreting a word with undefined interpretation semantics
@cindex Interpreting a compile-only word
For some words, we have defined interpretation semantics. For the
others: @code{-14 throw} (Interpreting a compile-only word).

@item modifying the contents of the input buffer or a string literal:
@cindex modifying the contents of the input buffer or a string literal
These are located in writable memory and can be modified.

@item overflow of the pictured numeric output string:
@cindex overflow of the pictured numeric output string
@cindex pictured numeric output string, overflow
@code{-17 throw} (Pictured numeric ouput string overflow).

@item parsed string overflow:
@cindex parsed string overflow
@code{PARSE} cannot overflow. @code{WORD} does not check for overflow.

@item producing a result out of range:
@cindex result out of range
On two's complement machines, arithmetic is performed modulo
2**bits-per-cell for single arithmetic and 4**bits-per-cell for double
arithmetic (with appropriate mapping for signed types). Division by zero
typically results in a @code{-10 throw} (divide by zero) or @code{-55
throw} (floating point unidentified fault). @code{convert} and
@code{>number} currently overflow silently.

@item reading from an empty data or return stack:
@cindex stack empty
@cindex stack underflow
@cindex return stack underflow
The data stack is checked by the outer (aka text) interpreter after
every word executed. If it has underflowed, a @code{-4 throw} (Stack
underflow) is performed. Apart from that, stacks may be checked or not,
depending on operating system, installation, and invocation. If they are
caught by a check, they typically result in @code{-4 throw} (Stack
underflow), @code{-6 throw} (Return stack underflow) or @code{-9 throw}
(Invalid memory address), depending on the platform and which stack
underflows and by how much. Note that even if the system uses checking
(through the MMU), your program may have to underflow by a significant
number of stack items to trigger the reaction (the reason for this is
that the MMU, and therefore the checking, works with a page-size
granularity).  If there is no checking, the symptoms resulting from an
underflow are similar to those from an overflow.  Unbalanced return
stack errors result in a variaty of symptoms, including @code{-9 throw}
(Invalid memory address) and Illegal Instruction (typically @code{-260
throw}).

@item unexpected end of the input buffer, resulting in an attempt to use a zero-length string as a name:
@cindex unexpected end of the input buffer
@cindex zero-length string as a name
@cindex Attempt to use zero-length string as a name
@code{Create} and its descendants perform a @code{-16 throw} (Attempt to
use zero-length string as a name). Words like @code{'} probably will not
find what they search. Note that it is possible to create zero-length
names with @code{nextname} (should it not?).

@item @code{>IN} greater than input buffer:
@cindex @code{>IN} greater than input buffer
The next invocation of a parsing word returns a string with length 0.

@item @code{RECURSE} appears after @code{DOES>}:
@cindex @code{RECURSE} appears after @code{DOES>}
Compiles a recursive call to the defining word, not to the defined word.

@item argument input source different than current input source for @code{RESTORE-INPUT}:
@cindex argument input source different than current input source for @code{RESTORE-INPUT}
@cindex argument type mismatch, @code{RESTORE-INPUT}
@cindex @code{RESTORE-INPUT}, Argument type mismatch
@code{-12 THROW}. Note that, once an input file is closed (e.g., because
the end of the file was reached), its source-id may be
reused. Therefore, restoring an input source specification referencing a
closed file may lead to unpredictable results instead of a @code{-12
THROW}.

In the future, Gforth may be able to restore input source specifications
from other than the current input source.

@item data space containing definitions gets de-allocated:
@cindex data space containing definitions gets de-allocated
Deallocation with @code{allot} is not checked. This typically results in
memory access faults or execution of illegal instructions.

@item data space read/write with incorrect alignment:
@cindex data space read/write with incorrect alignment
@cindex alignment faults
@cindex address alignment exception
Processor-dependent. Typically results in a @code{-23 throw} (Address
alignment exception). Under Linux-Intel on a 486 or later processor with
alignment turned on, incorrect alignment results in a @code{-9 throw}
(Invalid memory address). There are reportedly some processors with
alignment restrictions that do not report violations.

@item data space pointer not properly aligned, @code{,}, @code{C,}:
@cindex data space pointer not properly aligned, @code{,}, @code{C,}
Like other alignment errors.

@item less than u+2 stack items (@code{PICK} and @code{ROLL}):
Like other stack underflows.

@item loop control parameters not available:
@cindex loop control parameters not available
Not checked. The counted loop words simply assume that the top of return
stack items are loop control parameters and behave accordingly.

@item most recent definition does not have a name (@code{IMMEDIATE}):
@cindex most recent definition does not have a name (@code{IMMEDIATE})
@cindex last word was headerless
@code{abort" last word was headerless"}.

@item name not defined by @code{VALUE} used by @code{TO}:

@cindex @code{TO} on non-@code{VALUE}s
@cindex Invalid name argument, @code{TO}
@code{-32 throw} (Invalid name argument) (unless name is a local or was
defined by @code{CONSTANT}; in the latter case it just changes the constant).

@item name not found (@code{'}, @code{POSTPONE}, @code{[']}, @code{[COMPILE]}):
@cindex name not found (@code{'}, @code{POSTPONE}, @code{[']}, @code{[COMPILE]})
@cindex undefined word, @code{'}, @code{POSTPONE}, @code{[']}, @code{[COMPILE]}
@code{-13 throw} (Undefined word)

@item parameters are not of the same type (@code{DO}, @code{?DO}, @code{WITHIN}):
@cindex parameters are not of the same type (@code{DO}, @code{?DO}, @code{WITHIN})
Gforth behaves as if they were of the same type. I.e., you can predict
the behaviour by interpreting all parameters as, e.g., signed.

@item @code{POSTPONE} or @code{[COMPILE]} applied to @code{TO}:
@cindex @code{POSTPONE} or @code{[COMPILE]} applied to @code{TO}
Assume @code{: X POSTPONE TO ; IMMEDIATE}. @code{X} performs the
compilation semantics of @code{TO}.

@item String longer than a counted string returned by @code{WORD}:
@cindex string longer than a counted string returned by @code{WORD}
@cindex @code{WORD}, string overflow
Not checked. The string will be ok, but the count will, of course,
contain only the least significant bits of the length.

@item u greater than or equal to the number of bits in a cell (@code{LSHIFT}, @code{RSHIFT}):
@cindex @code{LSHIFT}, large shift counts
@cindex @code{RSHIFT}, large shift counts
Processor-dependent. Typical behaviours are returning 0 and using only
the low bits of the shift count.

@item word not defined via @code{CREATE}:
@cindex @code{>BODY} of non-@code{CREATE}d words
@code{>BODY} produces the PFA of the word no matter how it was defined.

@cindex @code{DOES>} of non-@code{CREATE}d words

@chapter Integrating Gforth into C programs

This is not yet implemented.

Several people like to use Forth as scripting language for applications
that are otherwise written in C, C++, or some other language.

The Forth system ATLAST provides facilities for embedding it into
applications; unfortunately it has several disadvantages: most
importantly, it is not based on ANS Forth, and it is apparently dead
(i.e., not developed further and not supported). The facilities
provided by Gforth in this area are inspired by ATLAST's facilities, so
making the switch should not be hard.

We also tried to design the interface such that it can easily be
implemented by other Forth systems, so that we may one day arrive at a
standardized interface. Such a standard interface would allow you to
replace the Forth system without having to rewrite C code.

You embed the Gforth interpreter by linking with the library
@code{libgforth.a} (give the compiler the option @code{-lgforth}).  All
global symbols in this library that belong to the interface, have the
prefix @code{forth_}. (Global symbols that are used internally have the
prefix @code{gforth_}).

You can include the declarations of Forth types and the functions and
variables of the interface with @code{#include <forth.h>}.

assertion messages are in the right format for Emacs' compilation mode
(@pxref{Compilation, , Running Compilations under Emacs, emacs, Emacs

Also, if you @code{include} @file{etags.fs}, a new @file{TAGS} file will

contains the definitions of all words defined afterwards. You can then
find the source for a word using @kbd{M-.}. Note that emacs can use
several tags files at the same time (e.g., one for the Gforth sources

An image created with @code{gforthmi} (@pxref{gforthmi}) or
@code{savesystem} (@pxref{Non-Relocatable Image Files}) includes the
original image; i.e., according to copyright law it is a derived work of
the original image.

Since Gforth is distributed under the GNU GPL, the newly created image
falls under the GNU GPL, too. In particular, this means that if you
distribute the image, you have to make all of the sources for the image
available, including those you wrote.  For details see @ref{License, ,
GNU General Public License (Section 3)}.

If you create an image with @code{cross} (@pxref{cross.fs}), the image
contains only code compiled from the sources you gave it; if none of
these sources is under the GPL, the terms discussed above do not apply
to the image. However, if your image needs an engine (a gforth binary)
that is under the GPL, you should make sure that you distribute both in
a way that is at most a @emph{mere aggregation}, if you don't want the
terms of the GPL to apply to the image.

@node Image File Background, Non-Relocatable Image Files, Image Licensing Issues, Image Files
@section Image File Background
@cindex image file background

Our Forth system consists not only of primitives, but also of
definitions written in Forth. Since the Forth compiler itself belongs to
those definitions, it is not possible to start the system with the
primitives and the Forth source alone. Therefore we provide the Forth
code as an image file in nearly executable form. When Gforth starts up,
a C routine loads the image file into memory, optionally relocates the
addresses, then sets up the memory (stacks etc.) according to
information in the image file, and (finally) starts executing Forth
code.

The image file variants represent different compromises between the
goals of making it easy to generate image files and making them
portable.

@cindex relocation at run-time
Win32Forth 3.4 and Mitch Bradley's @code{cforth} use relocation at
run-time. This avoids many of the complications discussed below (image
files are data relocatable without further ado), but costs performance
(one addition per memory access).

@cindex relocation at load-time
By contrast, the Gforth loader performs relocation at image load time. The
loader also has to replace tokens that represent primitive calls with the
appropriate code-field addresses (or code addresses in the case of
direct threading).

There are three kinds of image files, with different degrees of
relocatability: non-relocatable, data-relocatable, and fully relocatable
image files.

@cindex image file loader
@cindex relocating loader
@cindex loader for image files
These image file variants have several restrictions in common; they are
caused by the design of the image file loader:

@itemize @bullet
@item
There is only one segment; in particular, this means, that an image file
cannot represent @code{ALLOCATE}d memory chunks (and pointers to
them). The contents of the stacks are not represented, either.

@item
The only kinds of relocation supported are: adding the same offset to
all cells that represent data addresses; and replacing special tokens
with code addresses or with pieces of machine code.

If any complex computations involving addresses are performed, the
results cannot be represented in the image file. Several applications that
use such computations come to mind:
@itemize @minus
@item
Hashing addresses (or data structures which contain addresses) for table
lookup. If you use Gforth's @code{table}s or @code{wordlist}s for this
purpose, you will have no problem, because the hash tables are
recomputed automatically when the system is started. If you use your own
hash tables, you will have to do something similar.

@item
There's a cute implementation of doubly-linked lists that uses
@code{XOR}ed addresses. You could represent such lists as singly-linked
in the image file, and restore the doubly-linked representation on
startup.@footnote{In my opinion, though, you should think thrice before
using a doubly-linked list (whatever implementation).}

@item
The code addresses of run-time routines like @code{docol:} cannot be
represented in the image file (because their tokens would be replaced by
machine code in direct threaded implementations). As a workaround,
compute these addresses at run-time with @code{>code-address} from the
executions tokens of appropriate words (see the definitions of
@code{docol:} and friends in @file{kernel.fs}).

@item
On many architectures addresses are represented in machine code in some
shifted or mangled form. You cannot put @code{CODE} words that contain
absolute addresses in this form in a relocatable image file. Workarounds
are representing the address in some relative form (e.g., relative to
the CFA, which is present in some register), or loading the address from
a place where it is stored in a non-mangled form.

@section Non-Relocatable Image Files
@cindex non-relocatable image files
@cindex image file, non-relocatable

These files are simple memory dumps of the dictionary. They are specific
to the executable (i.e., @file{gforth} file) they were created
with. What's worse, they are specific to the place on which the
dictionary resided when the image was created. Now, there is no
guarantee that the dictionary will reside at the same place the next
time you start Gforth, so there's no guarantee that a non-relocatable
image will work the next time (Gforth will complain instead of crashing,
though).

You can create a non-relocatable image file with

@node Data-Relocatable Image Files, Fully Relocatable Image Files, Non-Relocatable Image Files, Image Files
@section Data-Relocatable Image Files
@cindex data-relocatable image files
@cindex image file, data-relocatable

These files contain relocatable data addresses, but fixed code addresses
(instead of tokens). They are specific to the executable (i.e.,
@file{gforth} file) they were created with. For direct threading on some
architectures (e.g., the i386), data-relocatable images do not work. You
get a data-relocatable image, if you use @file{gforthmi} with a
Gforth binary that is not doubly indirect threaded (@pxref{Fully
Relocatable Image Files}).

@node Fully Relocatable Image Files, Stack and Dictionary Sizes, Data-Relocatable Image Files, Image Files
@section Fully Relocatable Image Files
@cindex fully relocatable image files
@cindex image file, fully relocatable

@cindex @file{kern*.fi}, relocatability
@cindex @file{gforth.fi}, relocatability
These image files have relocatable data addresses, and tokens for code
addresses. They can be used with different binaries (e.g., with and
without debugging) on the same machine, and even across machines with
the same data formats (byte order, cell size, floating point
format). However, they are usually specific to the version of Gforth
they were created with. The files @file{gforth.fi} and @file{kernl*.fi}
are fully relocatable.

There are two ways to create a fully relocatable image file:

@menu
* gforthmi::            The normal way
* cross.fs::                    The hard way
@end menu

@node gforthmi, cross.fs, Fully Relocatable Image Files, Fully Relocatable Image Files
@subsection @file{gforthmi}
@cindex @file{comp-i.fs}
@cindex @file{gforthmi}

You will usually use @file{gforthmi}. If you want to create an
image @var{file} that contains everything you would load by invoking
Gforth with @code{gforth @var{options}}, you simply say
@example
gforthmi @var{file} @var{options}
@end example

E.g., if you want to create an image @file{asm.fi} that has the file
@file{asm.fs} loaded in addition to the usual stuff, you could do it
like this:

@example
gforthmi asm.fi asm.fs
@end example

@file{gforthmi} works like this: It produces two non-relocatable
images for different addresses and then compares them. Its output
reflects this: first you see the output (if any) of the two Gforth
invocations that produce the nonrelocatable image files, then you see
the output of the comparing program: It displays the offset used for
data addresses and the offset used for code addresses;
moreover, for each cell that cannot be represented correctly in the
image files, it displays a line like the following one:

@example
     78DC         BFFFFA50         BFFFFA40
@end example

This means that at offset $78dc from @code{forthstart}, one input image
contains $bffffa50, and the other contains $bffffa40. Since these cells
cannot be represented correctly in the output image, you should examine
these places in the dictionary and verify that these cells are dead
(i.e., not read before they are written).

@cindex doubly indirect threaded code
@cindex environment variable @code{GFORTHD}
@cindex @code{GFORTHD} environment variable
@cindex @code{gforth-ditc}
There are a few wrinkles: After processing the passed @var{options}, the
words @code{savesystem} and @code{bye} must be visible. A special doubly
indirect threaded version of the @file{gforth} executable is used for
creating the nonrelocatable images; you can pass the exact filename of
this executable through the environment variable @code{GFORTHD}
(default: @file{gforth-ditc}); if you pass a version that is not doubly
indirect threaded, you will not get a fully relocatable image, but a
data-relocatable image (because there is no code address offset).

@node cross.fs,  , gforthmi, Fully Relocatable Image Files
@subsection @file{cross.fs}
@cindex @file{cross.fs}
@cindex cross-compiler
@cindex metacompiler

You can also use @code{cross}, a batch compiler that accepts a Forth-like
programming language. This @code{cross} language has to be documented
yet.

@cindex target compiler
@code{cross} also allows you to create image files for machines with
different data sizes and data formats than the one used for generating
the image file. You can also use it to create an application image that
does not contain a Forth compiler. These features are bought with
restrictions and inconveniences in programming. E.g., addresses have to
be stored in memory with special words (@code{A!}, @code{A,}, etc.) in
order to make the code relocatable.


@node Stack and Dictionary Sizes, Running Image Files, Fully Relocatable Image Files, Image Files
@section Stack and Dictionary Sizes
@cindex image file, stack and dictionary sizes
@cindex dictionary size default
@cindex stack size default

If you invoke Gforth with a command line flag for the size
(@pxref{Invoking Gforth}), the size you specify is stored in the
dictionary. If you save the dictionary with @code{savesystem} or create
an image with @file{gforthmi}, this size will become the default
for the resulting image file. E.g., the following will create a
fully relocatable version of @file{gforth.fi} with a 1MB dictionary:

@example
gforthmi gforth.fi -m 1M
@end example

In other words, if you want to set the default size for the dictionary
and the stacks of an image, just invoke @file{gforthmi} with the
appropriate options when creating the image.

@cindex stack size, cache-friendly
Note: For cache-friendly behaviour (i.e., good performance), you should
make the sizes of the stacks modulo, say, 2K, somewhat different. E.g.,
the default stack sizes are: data: 16k (mod 2k=0); fp: 15.5k (mod
2k=1.5k); return: 15k(mod 2k=1k); locals: 14.5k (mod 2k=0.5k).

@example
gforth -i @var{image}
@end example

@cindex executable image file
@cindex image file, executable
If your operating system supports starting scripts with a line of the
form @code{#! ...}, you just have to type the image file name to start
Gforth with this image file (note that the file extension @code{.fi} is
just a convention). I.e., to run Gforth with the image file @var{image},
you can just type @var{image} instead of @code{gforth -i @var{image}}.

For example, if you place this text in a file:

@example
#! /usr/local/bin/gforth

." Hello, world" CR
bye

@end example

@noindent
And then make the file executable (chmod +x in Unix), you can run it
directly from the command line. The sequence @code{#!} is used in two
ways; firstly, it is recognised as a ``magic sequence'' by the operating
system, secondly it is treated as a comment character by Gforth. Because
of the second usage, a space is required between @code{#!} and the path
to the executable.
@comment TODO describe the #! magic with reference to the Power Tools book.

You can add your own initialization to the startup sequence through the
deferred word @code{'cold}. @code{'cold} is invoked just before the
image-specific command line processing (by default, loading files and
evaluating (@code{-e}) strings) starts.

A sequence for adding your initialization usually looks like this:

@example
:noname
    Defers 'cold \ do other initialization stuff (e.g., rehashing wordlists)
    ... \ your stuff
; IS 'cold
@end example

@cindex turnkey image files

You can make a turnkey image by letting @code{'cold} execute a word
(your turnkey application) that never returns; instead, it exits Gforth

@cindex arguments on the command line, access
You can access the (image-specific) command-line arguments through the
variables @code{argc} and @code{argv}. @code{arg} provides convenient
access to @code{argv}.

If @code{'cold} exits normally, Gforth processes the command-line
arguments as files to be loaded and strings to be evaluated.  Therefore,
@code{'cold} should remove the arguments it has used in this case.

@section Portability
@cindex engine portability

An important goal of the Gforth Project is availability across a wide
range of personal machines. fig-Forth, and, to a lesser extent, F83,
achieved this goal by manually coding the engine in assembly language
for several then-popular processors. This approach is very
labor-intensive and the results are short-lived due to progress in
computer architecture.

@cindex C, using C for the engine
Others have avoided this problem by coding in C, e.g., Mitch Bradley
(cforth), Mikael Patel (TILE) and Dirk Zoller (pfe). This approach is
particularly popular for UNIX-based Forths due to the large variety of
architectures of UNIX machines. Unfortunately an implementation in C
does not mix well with the goals of efficiency and with using
traditional techniques: Indirect or direct threading cannot be expressed
in C, and switch threading, the fastest technique available in C, is
significantly slower. Another problem with C is that it is very
cumbersome to express double integer arithmetic.

@cindex GNU C for the engine
@cindex long long
Fortunately, there is a portable language that does not have these
limitations: GNU C, the version of C processed by the GNU C compiler
(@pxref{C Extensions, , Extensions to the C Language Family, gcc.info,
GNU C Manual}). Its labels as values feature (@pxref{Labels as Values, ,
Labels as Values, gcc.info, GNU C Manual}) makes direct and indirect
threading possible, its @code{long long} type (@pxref{Long Long, ,
Double-Word Integers, gcc.info, GNU C Manual}) corresponds to Forth's
double numbers@footnote{Unfortunately, long longs are not implemented
properly on all machines (e.g., on alpha-osf1, long longs are only 64
bits, the same size as longs (and pointers), but they should be twice as
long according to @pxref{Long Long, , Double-Word Integers, gcc.info, GNU
C Manual}). So, we had to implement doubles in C after all. Still, on
most machines we can use long longs and achieve better performance than
with the emulation package.}. GNU C is available for free on all
important (and many unimportant) UNIX machines, VMS, 80386s running
MS-DOS, the Amiga, and the Atari ST, so a Forth written in GNU C can run
on all these machines.

Writing in a portable language has the reputation of producing code that
is slower than assembly. For our Forth engine we repeatedly looked at
the code produced by the compiler and eliminated most compiler-induced
inefficiencies by appropriate changes in the source code.

@cindex explicit register declarations
@cindex --enable-force-reg, configuration flag
@cindex -DFORCE_REG
However, register allocation cannot be portably influenced by the
programmer, leading to some inefficiencies on register-starved
machines. We use explicit register declarations (@pxref{Explicit Reg
Vars, , Variables in Specified Registers, gcc.info, GNU C Manual}) to
improve the speed on some machines. They are turned on by using the
configuration flag @code{--enable-force-reg} (@code{gcc} switch
@code{-DFORCE_REG}). Unfortunately, this feature not only depends on the
machine, but also on the compiler version: On some machines some
compiler versions produce incorrect code when certain explicit register
declarations are used. So by default @code{-DFORCE_REG} is not used.

@node Threading, Primitives, Portability, Engine
@section Threading
@cindex inner interpreter implementation
@cindex threaded code implementation

@cindex labels as values
GNU C's labels as values extension (available since @code{gcc-2.0},
@pxref{Labels as Values, , Labels as Values, gcc.info, GNU C Manual})
makes it possible to take the address of @var{label} by writing
@code{&&@var{label}}.  This address can then be used in a statement like
@code{goto *@var{address}}. I.e., @code{goto *&&x} is the same as
@code{goto x}.

@end example
@cindex instruction pointer
For those unfamiliar with the names: @code{ip} is the Forth instruction
pointer; the @code{cfa} (code-field address) corresponds to ANS Forths
execution token and points to the code field of the next word to be
executed; The @code{ca} (code address) fetched from there points to some
executable code, e.g., a primitive or the colon definition handler
@code{docol}.

@cindex direct threaded inner interpreter
@cindex inner interpreter, direct threaded
Direct threading is even simpler:
@example
ca = *ip++;
goto *ca;
@end example

Of course we have packaged the whole thing neatly in macros called
@code{NEXT} and @code{NEXT1} (the part of @code{NEXT} after fetching the cfa).

@subsection Scheduling
@cindex inner interpreter optimization

There is a little complication: Pipelined and superscalar processors,
i.e., RISC and some modern CISC machines can process independent
instructions while waiting for the results of an instruction. The
compiler usually reorders (schedules) the instructions in a way that
achieves good usage of these delay slots. However, on our first tries
the compiler did not do well on scheduling primitives. E.g., for
@code{+} implemented as
@example
n=sp[0]+sp[1];
sp++;
sp[0]=n;
NEXT;
@end example
the @code{NEXT} comes strictly after the other code, i.e., there is nearly no
scheduling. After a little thought the problem becomes clear: The
compiler cannot know that @code{sp} and @code{ip} point to different
addresses (and the version of @code{gcc} we used would not know it even
if it was possible), so it could not move the load of the cfa above the
store to the TOS. Indeed the pointers could be the same, if code on or
very near the top of stack were executed. In the interest of speed we
chose to forbid this probably unused ``feature'' and helped the compiler
in scheduling: @code{NEXT} is divided into the loading part (@code{NEXT_P1})
and the goto part (@code{NEXT_P2}). @code{+} now looks like:
@example
n=sp[0]+sp[1];
sp++;
NEXT_P1;
sp[0]=n;
NEXT_P2;
@end example
This can be scheduled optimally by the compiler.

This division can be turned off with the switch @code{-DCISC_NEXT}. This
switch is on by default on machines that do not profit from scheduling
(e.g., the 80386), in order to preserve registers.

@node Direct or Indirect Threaded?, DOES>, Scheduling, Threading
@subsection Direct or Indirect Threaded?
@cindex threading, direct or indirect?

@cindex -DDIRECT_THREADED
Both! After packaging the nasty details in macro definitions we
realized that we could switch between direct and indirect threading by
simply setting a compilation flag (@code{-DDIRECT_THREADED}) and
defining a few machine-specific macros for the direct-threading case.
On the Forth level we also offer access words that hide the
differences between the threading methods (@pxref{Threading Words}).

Indirect threading is implemented completely machine-independently.
Direct threading needs routines for creating jumps to the executable
code (e.g. to @code{docol} or @code{dodoes}). These routines are inherently
machine-dependent, but they do not amount to many source lines. Therefore,
even porting direct threading to a new machine requires little effort.

@cindex --enable-indirect-threaded, configuration flag
@cindex --enable-direct-threaded, configuration flag
The default threading method is machine-dependent. You can enforce a
specific threading method when building Gforth with the configuration
flag @code{--enable-direct-threaded} or
@code{--enable-indirect-threaded}. Note that direct threading is not
supported on all machines.

@node DOES>,  , Direct or Indirect Threaded?, Threading
@subsection DOES>
@cindex @code{DOES>} implementation

@cindex @code{dodoes} routine
@cindex @code{DOES>}-code
One of the most complex parts of a Forth engine is @code{dodoes}, i.e.,
the chunk of code executed by every word defined by a
@code{CREATE}...@code{DOES>} pair. The main problem here is: How to find
the Forth code to be executed, i.e. the code after the
@code{DOES>} (the @code{DOES>}-code)? There are two solutions:

In fig-Forth the code field points directly to the @code{dodoes} and the
@code{DOES>}code address is stored in the cell after the code address (i.e. at
@code{@var{CFA} cell+}). It may seem that this solution is illegal in
the Forth-79 and all later standards, because in fig-Forth this address
lies in the body (which is illegal in these standards). However, by
making the code field larger for all words this solution becomes legal
again. We use this approach for the indirect threaded version and for
direct threading on some machines. Leaving a cell unused in most words
is a bit wasteful, but on the machines we are targeting this is hardly a
problem. The other reason for having a code field size of two cells is
to avoid having different image files for direct and indirect threaded
systems (direct threaded systems require two-cell code fields on many
machines).

@cindex @code{DOES>}-handler
The other approach is that the code field points or jumps to the cell
after @code{DOES>}. In this variant there is a jump to @code{dodoes} at
this address (the @code{DOES>}-handler). @code{dodoes} can then get the
@code{DOES>}-code address by computing the code address, i.e., the address of
the jump to dodoes, and add the length of that jump field. A variant of
this is to have a call to @code{dodoes} after the @code{DOES>}; then the
return address (which can be found in the return register on RISCs) is
the @code{DOES>}-code address. Since the two cells available in the code field
are used up by the jump to the code address in direct threading on many
architectures, we use this approach for direct threading on these
architectures. We did not want to add another cell to the code field.

@node Automatic Generation, TOS Optimization, Primitives, Primitives
@subsection Automatic Generation
@cindex primitives, automatic generation

@cindex @file{prims2x.fs}
Since the primitives are implemented in a portable language, there is no
longer any need to minimize the number of primitives. On the contrary,
having many primitives has an advantage: speed. In order to reduce the
number of errors in primitives and to make programming them easier, we
provide a tool, the primitive generator (@file{prims2x.fs}), that
automatically generates most (and sometimes all) of the C code for a
primitive from the stack effect notation.  The source for a primitive
has the following form:

@cindex primitive source format
@format
@var{Forth-name}	@var{stack-effect}	@var{category}	[@var{pronounc.}]
[@code{""}@var{glossary entry}@code{""}]
@var{C code}
[@code{:}
@var{Forth code}]
@end format

The items in brackets are optional. The category and glossary fields
are there for generating the documentation, the Forth code is there
for manual implementations on machines without GNU C. E.g., the source
for the primitive @code{+} is:
@example
+    n1 n2 -- n    core    plus
n = n1+n2;
@end example

This looks like a specification, but in fact @code{n = n1+n2} is C
code. Our primitive generation tool extracts a lot of information from
the stack effect notations@footnote{We use a one-stack notation, even
though we have separate data and floating-point stacks; The separate
notation can be generated easily from the unified notation.}: The number
of items popped from and pushed on the stack, their type, and by what
name they are referred to in the C code. It then generates a C code
prelude and postlude for each primitive. The final C code for @code{+}
looks like this:

@example
I_plus:	/* + ( n1 n2 -- n ) */  /* label, stack effect */
/*  */                          /* documentation */
@{
DEF_CA                          /* definition of variable ca (indirect threading) */
Cell n1;                        /* definitions of variables */
Cell n2;
Cell n;
n1 = (Cell) sp[1];              /* input */
n2 = (Cell) TOS;
sp += 1;                        /* stack adjustment */
NAME("+")                       /* debugging output (with -DDEBUG) */
@{
n = n1+n2;                      /* C code taken from the source */
@}
NEXT_P1;                        /* NEXT part 1 */
TOS = (Cell)n;                  /* output */
NEXT_P2;                        /* NEXT part 2 */
@}
@end example

This looks long and inefficient, but the GNU C compiler optimizes quite
well and produces optimal code for @code{+} on, e.g., the R3000 and the
HP RISC machines: Defining the @code{n}s does not produce any code, and
using them as intermediate storage also adds no cost.

There are also other optimizations that are not illustrated by this
example: assignments between simple variables are usually for free (copy
propagation). If one of the stack items is not used by the primitive
(e.g.  in @code{drop}), the compiler eliminates the load from the stack
(dead code elimination). On the other hand, there are some things that
the compiler does not do, therefore they are performed by
@file{prims2x.fs}: The compiler does not optimize code away that stores
a stack item to the place where it just came from (e.g., @code{over}).

While programming a primitive is usually easy, there are a few cases
where the programmer has to take the actions of the generator into
account, most notably @code{?dup}, but also words that do not (always)
fall through to @code{NEXT}.

@node TOS Optimization, Produced code, Automatic Generation, Primitives
@subsection TOS Optimization
@cindex TOS optimization for primitives
@cindex primitives, keeping the TOS in a register

An important optimization for stack machine emulators, e.g., Forth
engines, is keeping  one or more of the top stack items in
registers.  If a word has the stack effect @var{in1}...@var{inx} @code{--}
@var{out1}...@var{outy}, keeping the top @var{n} items in registers
@itemize @bullet
@item
is better than keeping @var{n-1} items, if @var{x>=n} and @var{y>=n},
due to fewer loads from and stores to the stack.
@item is slower than keeping @var{n-1} items, if @var{x<>y} and @var{x<n} and
@var{y<n}, due to additional moves between registers.
@end itemize

@cindex -DUSE_TOS
@cindex -DUSE_NO_TOS
In particular, keeping one item in a register is never a disadvantage,
if there are enough registers. Keeping two items in registers is a
disadvantage for frequent words like @code{?branch}, constants,
variables, literals and @code{i}. Therefore our generator only produces
code that keeps zero or one items in registers. The generated C code
covers both cases; the selection between these alternatives is made at
C-compile time using the switch @code{-DUSE_TOS}. @code{TOS} in the C
code for @code{+} is just a simple variable name in the one-item case,
otherwise it is a macro that expands into @code{sp[0]}. Note that the
GNU C compiler tries to keep simple variables like @code{TOS} in
registers, and it usually succeeds, if there are enough registers.

@cindex -DUSE_FTOS
@cindex -DUSE_NO_FTOS
The primitive generator performs the TOS optimization for the
floating-point stack, too (@code{-DUSE_FTOS}). For floating-point
operations the benefit of this optimization is even larger:
floating-point operations take quite long on most processors, but can be
performed in parallel with other operations as long as their results are
not used. If the FP-TOS is kept in a register, this works. If
it is kept on the stack, i.e., in memory, the store into memory has to
wait for the result of the floating-point operation, lengthening the
execution time of the primitive considerably.

The TOS optimization makes the automatic generation of primitives a
bit more complicated. Just replacing all occurrences of @code{sp[0]} by
@code{TOS} is not sufficient. There are some special cases to
consider:
@itemize @bullet
@item In the case of @code{dup ( w -- w w )} the generator must not
eliminate the store to the original location of the item on the stack,
if the TOS optimization is turned on.
@item Primitives with stack effects of the form @code{--}
@var{out1}...@var{outy} must store the TOS to the stack at the start.
Likewise, primitives with the stack effect @var{in1}...@var{inx} @code{--}
must load the TOS from the stack at the end. But for the null stack
effect @code{--} no stores or loads should be generated.

@cindex performance of some Forth interpreters
@cindex engine performance
@cindex benchmarking Forth systems
@cindex Gforth performance

On RISCs the Gforth engine is very close to optimal; i.e., it is usually
impossible to write a significantly faster engine.

On register-starved machines like the 386 architecture processors
improvements are possible, because @code{gcc} does not utilize the
registers as well as a human, even with explicit register declarations;
e.g., Bernd Beuster wrote a Forth system fragment in assembly language
and hand-tuned it for the 486; this system is 1.19 times faster on the
Sieve benchmark on a 486DX2/66 than Gforth compiled with
@code{gcc-2.6.3} with @code{-DFORCE_REG}.

@cindex Win32Forth performance
@cindex NT Forth performance
@cindex eforth performance
@cindex ThisForth performance
@cindex PFE performance
@cindex TILE performance
However, this potential advantage of assembly language implementations
is not necessarily realized in complete Forth systems: We compared
Gforth (direct threaded, compiled with @code{gcc-2.6.3} and
@code{-DFORCE_REG}) with Win32Forth 1.2093, LMI's NT Forth (Beta, May
1994) and Eforth (with and without peephole (aka pinhole) optimization
of the threaded code); all these systems were written in assembly
language. We also compared Gforth with three systems written in C:
PFE-0.9.14 (compiled with @code{gcc-2.6.3} with the default
configuration for Linux: @code{-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -DUSE_REGS
-DUNROLL_NEXT}), ThisForth Beta (compiled with @code{gcc-2.6.3 -O3
-fomit-frame-pointer}; ThisForth employs peephole optimization of the
threaded code) and TILE (compiled with @code{make opt}). We benchmarked
Gforth, PFE, ThisForth and TILE on a 486DX2/66 under Linux. Kenneth
O'Heskin kindly provided the results for Win32Forth and NT Forth on a
486DX2/66 with similar memory performance under Windows NT. Marcel
Hendrix ported Eforth to Linux, then extended it to run the benchmarks,
added the peephole optimizer, ran the benchmarks and reported the
results.
 
We used four small benchmarks: the ubiquitous Sieve; bubble-sorting and
matrix multiplication come from the Stanford integer benchmarks and have
been translated into Forth by Martin Fraeman; we used the versions
included in the TILE Forth package, but with bigger data set sizes; and
a recursive Fibonacci number computation for benchmarking calling
performance. The following table shows the time taken for the benchmarks
scaled by the time taken by Gforth (in other words, it shows the speedup
factor that Gforth achieved over the other systems).

@example
relative      Win32-    NT       eforth       This-
  time  Gforth Forth Forth eforth  +opt   PFE Forth  TILE
sieve     1.00  1.39  1.14   1.39  0.85  1.58  3.18  8.58
bubble    1.00  1.31  1.41   1.48  0.88  1.50        3.88
matmul    1.00  1.47  1.35   1.46  0.74  1.58        4.09
fib       1.00  1.52  1.34   1.22  0.86  1.74  2.99  4.30
@end example

You may be quite surprised by the good performance of Gforth when
compared with systems written in assembly language. One important reason
for the disappointing performance of these other systems is probably
that they are not written optimally for the 486 (e.g., they use the
@code{lods} instruction). In addition, Win32Forth uses a comfortable,
but costly method for relocating the Forth image: like @code{cforth}, it
computes the actual addresses at run time, resulting in two address
computations per @code{NEXT} (@pxref{Image File Background}).

Only Eforth with the peephole optimizer has a performance that is
comparable to Gforth. The speedups achieved with peephole optimization
of threaded code are quite remarkable. Adding a peephole optimizer to
Gforth should cause similar speedups.

The speedup of Gforth over PFE, ThisForth and TILE can be easily
explained with the self-imposed restriction of the latter systems to
standard C, which makes efficient threading impossible (however, the
measured implementation of PFE uses a GNU C extension: @pxref{Global Reg
Vars, , Defining Global Register Variables, gcc.info, GNU C Manual}).
Moreover, current C compilers have a hard time optimizing other aspects
of the ThisForth and the TILE source.

The performance of Gforth on 386 architecture processors varies widely
with the version of @code{gcc} used. E.g., @code{gcc-2.5.8} failed to
allocate any of the virtual machine registers into real machine
registers by itself and would not work correctly with explicit register
declarations, giving a 1.3 times slower engine (on a 486DX2/66 running
the Sieve) than the one measured above.

Note that there have been several releases of Win32Forth since the
release presented here, so the results presented above may have little
predictive value for the performance of Win32Forth today.

@cindex @file{Benchres}
In @cite{Translating Forth to Efficient C} by M. Anton Ertl and Martin
Maierhofer (presented at EuroForth '95), an indirect threaded version of
Gforth is compared with Win32Forth, NT Forth, PFE, and ThisForth; that
version of Gforth is 2%@minus{}8% slower on a 486 than the direct
threaded version used here. The paper available at
@*@url{http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/papers/ertl&maierhofer95.ps.gz};
it also contains numbers for some native code systems. You can find a
newer version of these measurements at

The Gforth project was started in mid-1992 by Bernd Paysan and Anton
Ertl. The third major author was Jens Wilke.  Lennart Benschop (who was
one of Gforth's first users, in mid-1993) and Stuart Ramsden inspired us
with their continuous feedback. Lennart Benshop contributed
@file{glosgen.fs}, while Stuart Ramsden has been working on automatic
support for calling C libraries. Helpful comments also came from Paul
Kleinrubatscher, Christian Pirker, Dirk Zoller, Marcel Hendrix, John
Wavrik, Barrie Stott, Marc de Groot, and Jorge Acerada. Since the
release of Gforth-0.2.1 there were also helpful comments from many
others; thank you all, sorry for not listing you here (but digging
through my mailbox to extract your names is on my to-do list). Since the
release of Gforth-0.4.0 Neal Crook worked on the manual.

Gforth also owes a lot to the authors of the tools we used (GCC, CVS,
and autoconf, among others), and to the creators of the Internet: Gforth
was developed across the Internet, and its authors did not meet
physically for the first 4 years of development.

@section Pedigree
@cindex pedigree of Gforth

Gforth descends from bigFORTH (1993) and fig-Forth. Gforth and PFE (by
Dirk Zoller) will cross-fertilize each other. Of course, a significant
part of the design of Gforth was prescribed by ANS Forth.

Bernd Paysan wrote bigFORTH, a descendent from TurboForth, an unreleased
32 bit native code version of VolksForth for the Atari ST, written
mostly by Dietrich Weineck.

VolksForth descends from F83. It was written by Klaus Schleisiek, Bernd
Pennemann, Georg Rehfeld and Dietrich Weineck for the C64 (called
UltraForth there) in the mid-80s and ported to the Atari ST in 1986.

Henry Laxen and Mike Perry wrote F83 as a model implementation of the
Forth-83 standard. !! Pedigree? When?

A team led by Bill Ragsdale implemented fig-Forth on many processors in
1979. Robert Selzer and Bill Ragsdale developed the original
implementation of fig-Forth for the 6502 based on microForth.

The principal architect of microForth was Dean Sanderson. microForth was
FORTH, Inc.'s first off-the-shelf product. It was developed in 1976 for
the 1802, and subsequently implemented on the 8080, the 6800 and the
Z80.

All earlier Forth systems were custom-made, usually by Charles Moore,
who discovered (as he puts it) Forth during the late 60s. The first full
Forth existed in 1971.

A part of the information in this section comes from @cite{The Evolution
of Forth} by Elizabeth D. Rather, Donald R. Colburn and Charles
H. Moore, presented at the HOPL-II conference and preprinted in SIGPLAN
Notices 28(3), 1993.  You can find more historical and genealogical
