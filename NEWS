User-visible changes between 0.1beta and 0.2.0

Improved etags support.
more.fs allows output paging.
Changed popen and pclose to open-pipe and close-pipe.
Added form, rows, and cols.
Added compat/ directory containing ANS implementations of Gforth features.
added primitives EMIT-FILE, STDOUT, STDERR; EMIT and TYPE now work
through file words (and are redirectable).
Support architectures with buggy long longs (alpha-dec-osf).
Added tiny multitasker.
Size changes through the command line are passed to the image (and
saved with savesystem); the preamble specifies an interpreter and is
propagated by save-system.
Added tables (case-sensitive wordlists)
HEADER now stores the compilation wordlist in the header and REVEAL
reveals into that wordlist.
changed bahviour of system (no longer returns wretval, but puts it in
$?)  added (system) ( c_addr u -- wretval wior ).
Added the ability to combine arbitrary interpretation and compilation
semantics; state-smart words were generally rewritten to use that
mechanism.
' and ['] now give an error for compile-only words.
