User-visible changes between 0.3.0 and 0.4.0:

Operating environment:

Path handling: "." at the start of the path represents the directory
  the nearest enclosing file resides in (if there is none: the working
  directory). "~+" indicates the working directory.  The default path
  now has "." in front.
gforth and gforthmi is now more GNU standards compliant (wrt
  command-line options).
New command-line-option: --die-on-signal
Errors are now directed to stderr.
Stdout is now unbuffered, if it is a tty.
User input device redirection (for filters) is now possible.

Ports:

Now runs on IRIX (and other MIPS-based systems without linker-flag -d).
Direct threading now works on PowerPC (20% speedup on 604e).
Better support for m68k (thanks to Andreas Schwab and Jorge Acereda).
It is possible to create executables that contain the image (for
  non-OS systems).
Added a lot of embedded control (EC) stuff.

New, changed, and removed words:

Renamed F0 to FP0 (avoids unexpected behaviour in hex), added aliases
  SP0, RP0, LP0 (recommended for future use) for S0, R0, L0.
Renamed PARSE-WORD into SWORD (PARSE-WORD is used with the meaning of
  NAME in OpenBoot and dpans6 A.6.2.2008)
Added FPICK (suggested by Julian Noble).
Added EXCEPTION.
S" gforth" ENVIRONMENT? now produces the version-string.
Changed representation of types in struct package, and correspondingly
  changed names.

Miscellaneous:

Plain text documentation is now available in doc/gforth.txt.
Documentation improvements.
Wordlist structure changed.
Added mini-oof.
Reorganized files: added directories and reorganized many files into
  them; renamed files into 8.3 format to work with completely broken
  systems (but there are again some files that won't work there).
Bug fixes.
Various changes without log information only known as mega-patches.
More files in the compat library.



User-visible changes between 0.2.1 and 0.3.0:

Stack overflow detection by memory protection on most systems
	(allocation with mmap).
gforth.fi is now fully relocatable.
fully relocatable images are now easier to create.
added primitives K and UNDER+.
Win32 support.
Improved support for embedded controllers and other deprived environments.
some bug fixes.
added concept index; other documentation improvements.



User-visible changes between 0.2.0 and 0.2.1:

Bug fixes



User-visible changes between 0.1beta and 0.2.0:

Portability and Installation:

Support architectures with buggy long longs (alpha-dec-osf).
Better support for DOS and other non-Unix systems.
Size changes through the command line are passed to the image (and
saved with savesystem); the preamble specifies an interpreter and is
propagated by save-system.

Tools:

Improved etags support.
more.fs allows output paging.
Added compat/ directory containing ANS implementations of Gforth features.
Added tiny multitasker (tasker.fs).
Added two alternatives for object-oriented programming: oof.fs, objects.fs.
Added ans-report.fs (reports which words are used from which wordset).

New words:

Changed POPEN and PCLOSE to OPEN-PIPE and CLOSE-PIPE.
Added FORM, ROWS, and COLS.
added primitives EMIT-FILE, STDOUT, STDERR.
Added TABLEs (case-sensitive wordlists).
added POSTPONE,.
Added the ability to combine arbitrary interpretation and compilation
semantics (INTERPRET/COMPILE:); state-smart words were generally
rewritten to use that mechanism.

Changes to existing words:

EMIT and TYPE now work through file words (and are redirectable).
HEADER now stores the compilation wordlist in the header and REVEAL
reveals into that wordlist.
changed behaviour of SYSTEM (no longer returns wretval, but puts it in
$?)  added (SYSTEM) ( c_addr u -- wretval wior ).
' and ['] now give an error for compile-only words.
