Some benchmark results for various combinations of hardware, Gforth
version, and Gforth configuration. You can measure your combination
with `make bench'. You can find a table comparing Gforth with four
interpretive Forth systems in the manual (Section Performance), and a
comparison with more systems in
http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/pub/papers/ertl&maierhofer95.ps.gz.

All times are given in seconds of user time.
