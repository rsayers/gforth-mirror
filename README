This is the current state (alpha) of gforth. This is not a
distribution for the general public, since it is not yet mature
enough. There is no warranty of any kind; this program is
distributed under the GNU General Public license (see COPYING).

You will probably find a Linux binary included in the package and the
configuration set up for Linux. If you want to install it on another
system, read INSTALL and I wish you good luck (Mail us if you have
problems).

To start the system just say `gforth'. This gives you a pretty barren
system. `gforth startup.fs' gives you most ANSI wordsets. If you miss
a word, just grep for it in *.fs.

If you want to work on gforth, mail me an encrypted UNIX password
(i.e., what you find in /etc/passwd). Tasks to be done can be found in
ToDo; but if you would like to do something not mentioned there, it's
ok, too. In any case, we would like to hear what you are doing. The
most important tasks IMO are the configuartion script, the missing ANS
Forth words (musts before the alpha release), speeding up the loading
of startup.fs, the documentation, adding readline and the foreign
language interface for C.
