This is the current state (alpha) of gforth. This is not a
distribution for the general public, since it is not yet mature
enough. There is no warranty of any kind; this program is
distributed under the GNU General Public license (see COPYING).

Read INSTALL for installation instructions. Mail us if you have
problems.

To start the system just say `gforth'. This gives you a pretty barren
system. `gforth startup.fs' gives you most ANSI wordsets. If you miss
a word, just grep for it in *.fs.

If you want to work on gforth, mail me. Tasks to be done can be found
in ToDo; but if you would like to do something not mentioned there,
it's ok, too. In any case, we would like to hear what you are
doing. The most important tasks IMO are the missing ANS Forth words
(musts before the alpha release), the documentation and the foreign
language interface for C.

On popular request, here are the meanings of unusual file extensions:

*.fs	Forth stream source file
*.fi	Forth image files
*.fb	Forth blocks file
*.i	C include files
*.ds	documenation source
*TAGS	etags files
