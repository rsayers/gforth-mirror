Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth
language. It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some nice
features such as a powerful locals facility, and even has (the
beginnings of) a manual. Gforth employs traditional implementation
techniques: its inner innerpreter is indirect or direct threaded.
Gforth is distributed under the GNU General Public license (see
COPYING).

Gforth runs under Unix and DOS and should not be hard to port to other
systems supported by GCC. This version has been tested on Linux (for
Intel), SunOS (SPARC), Ultrix (MIPS) before release.

Read INSTALL for installation instructions. Mail
gforth-bugs@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at if you have problems.  To start
the system, just say `gforth' (after installing it).

If you want to work on Gforth, mail me. Tasks to be done can be found
in ToDo; but if you would like to do something not mentioned there,
it's ok, too. In any case, we would like to hear what you are
doing. The most important tasks IMO are the missing ANS Forth words,
the documentation and the foreign language interface for C.
