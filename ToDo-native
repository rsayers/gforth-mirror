end of acondbranch needs checking (double INST_TAIL? No LABEL2 before NEXT_P2?)
TRY does not produce a correct recovery address for THROW.
lib.fs does some funny things to the return address (certainly does
  not work with gforth-native).
The >EXEC trick (users: >STDERR) might work, but I am not sure.
