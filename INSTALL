You need gcc version 2.0 or later to compile gforth.

First, type

./configure

configure has the following useful parameters:
  --enable-force-reg      Use explicit register declarations if they appear in
                          the machine.h file. This can cause a good speedup,
                          but also incorrect code with some gcc versions on
                          some processors (default disabled).
  --enable-direct-threaded      Force direct threading. This may not work on
                                some machines and may cause slowdown on others.
                                (default processor-dependent)
  --enable-indirect-threaded    Force indirect threading. This can cause a
                                slowdown on some machines.
                                (default processor-dependent)
  --with-debug     specifies option -g to compile with debug info (default)
   --without-debug  omits the -g switch and creates smaller images on
                    machines where strip has problems with gcc style
                    debugging informations.
  --help: tells you about other parameters.


Now type

make

If your make has trouble with the Makefile, "make gforth" might work.

If your installed gcc isn't called "gcc" (eg. called "gcc-2.6.1"), type

make GCC=<whatever you call your gcc>

instead.

Now you can check whether your shiny new Forth system works. Say

make test

To make the documentation, type

make -k gforth.info gforth.ps html

If everything is allright, you may want to install gforth. Type

make install

You may want to override the defaults for the directories. E.g., if
you want to install in the /gnu hierarchy instead of in the default
/usr/local hirarchy, say

make install prefix=/gnu

Alternatively, you can specify the prefixes with configure.
