Very preliminary version

Create a machine description file for your machine, if necessary.

Make a symbolic link to machine.h, e.g.

ln -s decstation.h machine.h

Make a symbolic link from mach32l.fs or mach32b.fs to machine.fs

Edit the Makefile (in particular the SWITCHES variable)

Now you can type

make
